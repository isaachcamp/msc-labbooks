	abstract = {The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of extratropical Southern Hemisphere climate variability, associated with changes in the strength and position of the polar jet around Antarctica. This variability in the polar jet drives large fluctuations in the Southern Hemisphere climate, from the lower stratosphere into the troposphere, and stretching from the midlatitudes across the Southern Ocean to Antarctica. Notably, the SAM index has displayed marked positive trends in the austral summer season (stronger and poleward shifted westerlies), associated with stratospheric ozone loss. Historical reconstructions demonstrate that these recent positive SAM index values are unprecedented in the last millennia, and fall outside the range of natural climate variability. Despite these advances in the understanding of the SAM behavior, several areas of active research are identified that highlight gaps in our present knowledge.

	abstract = {Abstract An observed trend in the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) during recent decades has involved an intensification of the polar vortex. The source of this trend is a matter of scientific debate with stratospheric ozone losses, greenhouse gas increases, and natural variability all being possible contenders. Because it is difficult to separate the contribution of various external forcings to the observed trend, a state-of-the-art global coupled model is utilized here. Ensembles of twentieth-century simulations forced with the observed time series of greenhouse gases, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, sulfate aerosols, volcanic aerosols, solar variability, and various combinations of these are used to examine the annular mode trends in comparison to observations, in an attempt to isolate the response of the climate system to each individual forcing. It is found that ozone changes are the biggest contributor to the observed summertime intensification of the southern polar vortex in the second half of the twentieth century, with increases of greenhouse gases also being a necessary factor in the reproduction of the observed trends at the surface. Although stratospheric ozone losses are expected to stabilize and eventually recover to preindustrial levels over the course of the twenty-first century, these results show that increasing greenhouse gases will continue to intensify the polar vortex throughout the twenty-first century, but that radiative forcing will cause widespread temperature increases over the entire Southern Hemisphere.},

	abstract = {Abstract A detailed view of Southern Hemisphere storm tracks is obtained based on the application of filtered variance and modern feature-tracking techniques to a wide range of 45-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. It has been checked that the conclusions drawn in this study are valid even if data from only the satellite era are used. The emphasis of the paper is on the winter season, but results for the four seasons are also discussed. Both upper- and lower-tropospheric fields are used. The tracking analysis focuses on systems that last longer than 2 days and are mobile (move more than 1000 km). Many of the results support previous ideas about the storm tracks, but some new insights are also obtained. In the summer there is a rather circular, strong, deep high-latitude storm track. In winter the high-latitude storm track is more asymmetric with a spiral from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in toward Antarctica and a subtropical jet–related lower-latitude storm track over the Pacific, again tending to spiral poleward. At all times of the year, maximum storm activity in the higher-latitude storm track is in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions. In the winter upper troposphere, the relative importance of, and interplay between, the subtropical and subpolar storm tracks is discussed. The genesis, lysis, and growth rate of lower-tropospheric winter cyclones together lead to a vivid picture of their behavior that is summarized as a set of overlapping plates, each composed of cyclone life cycles. Systems in each plate appear to feed the genesis in the next plate through downstream development in the upper-troposphere spiral storm track. In the lee of the Andes in South America, there is cyclogenesis associated with the subtropical jet and also, poleward of this, cyclogenesis largely associated with system decay on the upslope and regeneration on the downslope. The genesis and lysis of cyclones and anticyclones have a definite spatial relationship with each other and with the Andes. At 500 hPa, their relative longitudinal positions are consistent with vortex-stretching ideas for simple flow over a large-scale mountain. Cyclonic systems near Antarctica have generally spiraled in from lower latitudes. However, cyclogenesis associated with mobile cyclones occurs around the Antarctic coast with an interesting genesis maximum over the sea ice near 150°E. The South Pacific storm track emerges clearly from the tracking as a coherent deep feature spiraling from Australia to southern South America. A feature of the summer season is the genesis of eastward-moving cyclonic systems near the tropic of Capricorn off Brazil, in the central Pacific and, to a lesser extent, off Madagascar, followed by movement along the southwest flanks of the subtropical anticyclones and contribution to the “convergence zone” cloud bands seen in these regions.},

It considers motions with horizontal scales of hundreds of kilometers or longer, vertical scales on the order of the depth of the troposphere, and timescales on the order of a day or longer. Motions on these scales are directly and strongly influenced by the Earth's rotation, they are in hydrostatic balance, and the vertical component of the three-dimensional velocity vector is more than three orders of smaller magnitude than the horizontal component but is nonetheless of critical importance. The chapter also introduces some concepts and definitions that are useful in characterizing horizontal flow patterns. It is followed by a more extensive review on the dynamics of large-scale horizontal motions on a rotating planet. The chapter further introduces the system of primitive equations, which is widely used for predicting how large-scale motions evolve with time. The chapter concludes with brief discussions on the atmospheric general circulation and numerical weather prediction.},

	abstract = {Rainfall that sustains life on Earth is not the bounty of cloud microphysical processes alone. Without vigorous and sustained motions, the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle would stagnate. Much of the ascent that drives the hydrologic cycle in the Earth's atmosphere occurs in association with weather systems with well-defined structures and life cycles. A small fraction of these systems achieve the status of storms capable of disrupting human activities and, in some instances, inflicting damage. This chapter introduces the structure and underlying dynamics of weather systems and their associated weather phenomena. The chapter deals with large-scale extratropical weather systems (baroclinic waves and the associated extratropical cyclones) and their embedded mesoscale fronts. It discusses some of the effects of terrain on large-scale weather systems and some of the associated weather phenomena. It describes the modes of mesoscale organization of deep cumulus convection and a special form of organization in which a mesoscale convective system acquires strong rotation. These tropical cyclones tend to be tighter, more axially symmetric, and more intense than their extratropical counterparts.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores the fascinating behavior of the boundary layer and the turbulent motions within it. The Earth's surface is the bottom boundary of the atmosphere. The portion of the atmosphere most affected by that boundary is called the atmospheric boundary layer or boundary layer for short. The thickness of the boundary layer is quite variable in space and time. Turbulence and static stability conspire to sandwich a strong stable layer called a capping inversion between the boundary layer below and the rest of the troposphere above called the free atmosphere. This stable layer traps turbulence, pollutants, and moisture below it and prevents most of the surface friction from being felt by the free atmosphere. Turbulence is ubiquitous within the boundary layer and is responsible for efficiently dispersing the pollutants that accompany modern life. Turbulent communication between the surface and the air is quite rapid, allowing the air to quickly take on characteristics of the underlying surface. In fact, one definition of the boundary layer is that portion of the lower troposphere that feels the effects of the underlying surface within about 30 min or less. Turbulence is inspiringly complex, consisting of a superposition of swirls called “eddies” that interact nonlinearly to create quasi-random, chaotic motions. An infinite number of equations are required to fully describe these motions. Hence, a complete solution has not been found.},

	abstract = {Abstract In a zonally symmetric climatology with a single eddy-driven jet, such as prevails in the Southern Hemisphere summer, the midlatitude variability is dominated by fluctuations of the jet around its mean position, as described by the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM). To study whether this result holds for a zonally asymmetric climatology, the observed variability of the Southern Hemisphere winter is analyzed. The mean state in this case is characterized by relatively weak stationary waves; yet there exist significant zonal variations in the mean strength and meridional structure of the subtropical jet stream. As in summer, the winter SAM signature is annular in shape and the corresponding wind anomalies are dipolar; but it is associated with two different behaviors of the eddy-driven jet in different longitudinal ranges. Over the Indian Ocean, the SAM is associated primarily with a latitudinal shift of the jet around its mean position. Over the Pacific sector, it is instead characterized by a seesaw in the wind speed between two distinct latitudes, corresponding to the positions of the midlatitude and subtropical jets. Composites of eddy forcing and baroclinicity over both sectors appear consistent with the two different behaviors. As in the zonal-mean case, high-frequency eddies both force and maintain the low-frequency wind anomalies associated with the SAM. The positive feedback by eddies is, however, not local: changes in the eddy forcing are influenced most strongly by zonal wind anomalies located upstream.},

	abstract = {Abstract From 1979 to 1989, global European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses of many meteorological variables important in baroclinic storms have been bandpass filtered to highlight fluctuations on 2- to 8-day time scales in order to illuminate the relationships among the variables in baroclinic storm-track regions. Because of the greater zonal symmetry in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) versus the Northern Hemisphere (NH), it is possible to examine these relationships over a zonal sector without being dominated by local effects associated with jet stream entrance and exit regions of the storm tracks. The bandpassed variance of geopotential height is used to define the storm track, and its meridional profile has a pronounced midlatitude maximum in the SH. The locations of the jet stream and the variance maxima of meridional and zonal velocity components, vorticity, vertical motion, specific humidity, and temperature all bear a distinctive relationship to the storm track, but the latitudes of their maxima are displaced from the center of the storm track. Many covariance quantities such as the transient eddy temperature, moisture, vorticity, and vertical and horizontal momentum fluxes also exhibit a strong storm-track signature. The observed relationships among the eddy quantities can generally be understood in terms of geostrophic theory and perturbation analysis applied to baroclinic systems. Storm-track activity is remarkably persistent throughout the year in both location and intensity in the SH. The storm track is farthest poleward in the transition seasons as part of a semiannual cycle, but remains near 50°S year round, and is strongest in the southern Indian Ocean and weakest in the South Pacific. There is a strong relationship between the storm track and the major tropospheric polar jet stream and its associated lower-level baroclinicity throughout the year, and the distribution of storm-track activity can be accounted for by baroclinic theory. In contrast to the NH, strongest meridional temperature gradients in middle latitudes are found in the summer half-year in the SH. Whereas the NH storm-track activity is much weaker in summer and shifts poleward, the SH activity is as strong as in winter and, if anything, shifts slightly equatorward. The zonal symmetry is greater in summer and meridional profiles are sharper, implying less variability in the storm track both within and between seasons. In winter, high-frequency storm-track activity extends over a broader range of latitudes and continues to be mainly associated with the polar jet stream. The question of the impact of the storm-track eddies on the mean flow is examined using zonal mean and a localized Eliassen–Palm flux. Baroclinic effects from the poleward heat flux dominate in winter and the eddies act to decelerate the upper tropospheric westerlies. Barotropic effects in the upper troposphere, mostly from the meridional momentum flux convergence, help to maintain the mean westerly distribution by accelerating the main polar jet and maintaining the mean split in the flow near New Zealand in both summer and winter and even dominate the baroclinic component in the storm track in summer. Diabatic heating by the eddies may also help maintain the mean flow.},

	abstract = {Abstract An objective method is developed and used to derive a climatology of centers of cyclonic vorticity for the Southern Hemisphere, based on twice-daily European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 1000-hPa analyses during 1980–86. These centers were computed as local minima of geostrophic relative vorticity ζg, extending previous studies based on pressure minima. This use of ζg, avoids a bias favoring slower and/or deeper cyclones that occurs when pressure is used and includes a large number of additional mobile vorticity centers in the 45°–55°S band that are missed where a local pressure minimum cannot be found. An automated tracking algorithm similar to that of Murray and Simmonds is used to match predicted location, pressure, and ζg from previous track history with available centers. Large numbers of ζg centers were found south of 60°S and near the midlatitude continents, as in previous studies. These were a mixture of migratory centers and other fixed topographic features. The maxima around Antarctica may include many spurious centers that are artifacts of a fictitious surface anticyclone over the elevated continent. Maxima around East Antarctica were located near katabatic-prone stations. Large counts near the three midiatitude landmasses were mostly heat lows and lee troughs. These stationary orographic features were eliminated to retain just the traveling disturbances that dominate the weather and climate of the region. These mobile centers were distributed much more uniformly. When centers were counted just once per grid square per cyclone, the resulting “track density” maximized year-round in a belt near 50°S rather than within the cyclone “graveyard” of the circumpolar trough, in good agreement with baroclinic storm tracks obtained elsewhere from eddy statistics. A second maximum associated with the subtropical jet was found during winter and spring near 40°S in the New Zealand-Pacific sector. Intense cyclones, stratified by ζg, occurred most frequently in winter near New Zealand, east of South America, and in the southern Indian Ocean. An apparent increase in cyclone numbers in early 1933 coincided with the introduction of envelope orography at the ECMWF.},

Prior smoothing of the raw data with a constant radius spatial filter is used to remove distortions related to the particular grid configuration used and to consistently admit a known scale of disturbance over the domain. Pitfalls of using central pressure or vorticity to infer cyclone intensity are illustrated, and a procedure for obtaining a more realistic areal measure of circulation is described. An automated selection procedure for storms having specific properties is outlined. Case selection is by computer search of a database of cyclone tracks, obtained from an application of the cyclone finding and tracking procedure to an extended series of gridded mean sea level pressure analyses. A selection of winter season cyclone statistics for both hemispheres is obtained from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses. Discrepancies with and between earlier studies appear more related to differing cyclone detection and counting procedures than to any intrinsic variability in analysis quality or cyclone occurrence. Results are found in agreement with the widely accepted manually produced climatologies only when a similar cyclone counting procedure is used. As in previous studies, Northern Hemisphere cyclones form and intensify near the eastern seaboards of Asia and North America, with maximum activity near SST gradients. They move eastward and poleward during their lives before weakening in the Gulf of Alaska and near Iceland. Southern Hemisphere cyclones are more evenly distributed around the hemisphere. They tend to form and intensify in middle latitudes, near SST gradients over open oceans, and near the eastern coasts of South America and Australia, and decay at higher latitudes. There is some evidence that newly formed and intensifying cyclones in both hemispheres possess a tighter inner structure than mature and decaying systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Southern Hemisphere mid- to upper-tropospheric planetary wave activity is characterized by the superposition of two zonally oriented, quasi-stationary waveforms: zonal wavenumber 1 (ZW1) and zonal wavenumber 3 (ZW3). Previous studies have tended to consider these waveforms in isolation and with the exception of those studies relating to sea ice, little is known about their impact on regional climate variability. A novel approach is taken to quantifying the combined influence of ZW1 and ZW3, using the strength of the hemispheric meridional flow as a proxy for zonal wave activity. The methodology adapts the wave envelope construct routinely used in the identification of synoptic-scale Rossby wave packets and improves on existing approaches by allowing for variations in both wave phase and amplitude. While ZW1 and ZW3 are both prominent features of the climatological circulation, the defining feature of highly meridional hemispheric states is an enhancement of the ZW3 component. Composites of the mean surface conditions during these highly meridional, ZW3-like anomalous states (i.e., months of strong planetary wave activity) reveal large sea ice anomalies over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas during autumn and along much of the East Antarctic coastline throughout the year. Large precipitation anomalies in regions of significant topography (e.g., New Zealand, Patagonia, and coastal Antarctica) and anomalously warm temperatures over much of the Antarctic continent were also associated with strong planetary wave activity. The latter has potentially important implications for the interpretation of recent warming over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.},

	abstract = {A distinctive feature of the Southern Hemisphere extratropical atmospheric circulation is the quasi-stationary zonal wave 3 pattern. This pattern is present in both the mean atmospheric circulation and its variability on daily, seasonal and interannual timescales. While the zonal wave 3 pattern has substantial impacts on meridional heat transport and Antarctic sea ice extent, the reason for its existence remains uncertain, although it has long been assumed to be linked to the presence of three major landmasses in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Here we use an atmospheric general circulation model to show that the stationary zonal wave 3 pattern is instead driven by zonally asymmetric deep convection in the tropics, with little influence from extratropical orography or landmasses. Localized regions of deep convection in the tropics form a local Hadley cell, which in turn creates a wave source in the subtropics that excites a poleward- and eastward-propagating wave train, forming quasi-stationary waves in the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes. Our findings suggest that changes in tropical deep convection, either due to natural variability or climate change, fundamentally control the zonal wave 3 pattern, with implications for southern high-latitude climate, ocean circulation and sea ice.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study examines the month-to-month variations in the tracks of Southern Hemisphere weather systems and their relation to low-frequency circulation variability. Cyclones and anticyclones are identified and tracked from ECMWF analyses during 1980–94 via an automated method and the principal patterns of variation identified by EOF analysis of monthly track density anomaly fields. Only the first three EOFs of cyclone track density involving about one-third of the total track variance were distinguishable from noise. Spatial patterns derived from both unrotated and rotated EOF analysis were not reproducible on subsets of the data, pointing to secular changes in the variance structure of the cyclone dataset. An increase in cyclone numbers over the Southern Ocean during the 1980s suggested that detection of small-scale cyclones is sensitive to changes in data coverage and analysis procedure, as associated changes in the mean circulation were small during this period. EOFs of anticyclone track data were found to be more robust, indicating a variety of seesaw patterns across the hemisphere. The leading modes of sea level pressure variability are found to be associated with regional variations in cyclone and anticyclone activity. The first pressure EOF, the so-called high-latitude mode, modulates cyclone activity between middle and high latitudes, with increased (decreased) westerlies near 55°–56°S accompanied by more (fewer) cyclones in the circumpolar regions and fewer (more) in middle latitudes. The second and third EOFs have centers of action near 60°S, 120°W and 55°S, 165°W, respectively, and are linked with blocking activity in these two regions. Blocks in the New Zealand sector occur in conjunction with a zonal wavenumber 3 pattern, while southeast Pacific blocks have no significant correlations outside the Pacific. A coherent cyclone response to ENSO was also found. During El Niño winters, increased cyclone activity occurs in a band spiraling southeastward from the subtropical Pacific toward South America, while fewer cyclones are found across the subtropical Indian Ocean, Australasia, and the southwest Pacific. During La Niñas, these patterns are almost exactly reversed, suggesting a predominantly linear cyclone response to ENSO.},

Generating SH cyclone tracks from global reanalysis datasets is problematic due to data reliability, especially prior to 1979. It is therefore prudent to compare the climatology and variability of SH cyclone tracks from different reanalysis datasets. We generate cyclone track frequency and intensity climatologies from three reanalysis datasets: The National Center for Environmental Prediction’s Reanalysis I and Reanalysis II datasets and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ERA-40 dataset. Our results show that ERA-40 produces more intense cyclones in the SH active cyclone region compared to NCEP reanalyses. More intense storms are also found in the SH active cyclone region in NCEP reanalyses data post-1979 reflecting the positive trend in the AAO in the past few decades. When evaluating interannual variability, our results show Rossby wave trains including the Pacific South American (PSA) and the East Indian Ocean pattern in response to anomalous heating linked to El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), respectively. Response to the AAO shows a robust annular structure for cyclone track frequency, but not intensity suggesting a weak relationship between cyclone frequency and cyclone intensity.},

This study has been conducted with a two-level primitive equation eigenvalue model and the growing modes for both January and July averaged basic states are examined. In both seasons, the fastest-growing cyclogenesis modes have largest amplitudes in the eastern part of the hemisphere just downstream of the polar jet stream maxima. In July, there is a tendency to form elongated eddies in the region downstream of Australia where growth on both polar and subtropical jet streams occurs. These results are in general agreement with the observational studies of Southern Hemisphere storm tracks. For both January and July, larger-scale slower-propagating dipole or multipole modes are found that are consistent with blocking in some or all of the observed locations in the Australian/New Zealand region, east of the Falklands, and to the southeast of South Africa. The faster-growing low-frequency anomaly modes have their primary centers located to the south of 60°S and have features in common with either or both of high-latitude and wavenumber 3 observed Southern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns or, to a lesser extent, with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation anomaly patterns for 1982–1983.

	abstract = {Abstract The association between Southern Hemisphere cyclones and anticyclones and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), southern annular mode (SAM), Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE), and rainfall in Perth and Melbourne is explored. Those cities are, respectively, located in the southwestern and southeastern corners of Australia, where substantial decreasing rainfall trends have been observed over the last decades. The need for a more unified understanding of large-scale anomalies in storm indicators associated with the climate features itemized above has motivated this study. The main aim is to identify cyclone-anomalous areas that are potentially important in characterizing continental rainfall anomalies from a hemispheric perspective, focusing on midlatitude Australia. The study covers the “satellite era” from 1979 to 2003 and was conducted for the southern winter when midlatitude rainfall is predominantly baroclinic. The results indicate a well-organized hemispheric cyclone pattern associated with ENSO, SAM, SIE, and rainfall anomalies. There is a moderate large-scale, high-latitude resemblance between La Niña, negative SAM, and reduced SIE in some sectors. In particular, there is a suggestion that SIE anomalies over the Indian Ocean and Western Australia sectors are associated with a large-scale pattern of cyclone/anticyclone anomalies that is more pronounced over the longitudes of Australia and New Zealand. Spatial correlation analysis suggests a robust link between cyclone density over the sectors mentioned above and rainfall in Perth and Melbourne. Statistical analyses of rainfall and SIE show modest correlations for Perth and weak correlations for Melbourne, generally corroborating the above. It is proposed that SAM and SIE are part of a complex physical system that is best understood as a coupled mechanism, and that their impacts on the circulation can be seen as partially independent of ENSO. While SAM and SIE have greater influence on the circulation affecting rainfall in the western side of Australia, ENSO is the dominant influence on the eastern half of the country. A contraction of the sea ice seems to be accompanied by a southward shift of high-latitude cyclones, which is also hypothesized to increase downstream cyclone density at midlatitudes via conservation of mass, similarly to what is observed during the extreme positive phase of the SAM. These associations build on previous developments in the literature. They bring a more unified view on high-latitude climate features, and may also help to explain the declining trends in Australian rainfall.},

	abstract = {The primary focus of this review is tropical-extratropical interactions and especially the issues involved in determining the response of the extratropical atmosphere to tropical forcing associated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The review encompasses observations, empirical studies, theory and modeling of the extratropical teleconnections with a focus on developments over the Tropical Oceans-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) decade and the current state of understanding. In the tropical atmosphere, anomalous SSTs force anomalies in convection and large-scale overturning with subsidence in the descending branch of the local Hadley circulation. The resulting strong upper tropospheric divergence in the tropics and convergence in the subtropics act as a Rossby wave source. The climatological stationary planetary waves and associated jet streams, especially in the northern hemisphere, can make the total Rossby wave sources somewhat insensitive to the position of the tropical heating that induces them and thus can create preferred teleconnection response patterns, such as the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. However, a number of factors influence the dispersion and propagation of Rossby waves through the atmosphere, including zonal asymmetries in the climatological state, transients, and baroclinic and nonlinear effects. Internal midlatitude sources can amplify perturbations. Observations, modeling, and theory have clearly shown how storm tracks change in response to changes in quasi-stationary waves and how these changes generally feedback to maintain or strengthen the dominant perturbations through vorticity and momentum transports. The response of the extratropical atmosphere naturally induces changes in the underlying surface, so that there are changes in extratropical SSTs and changes in land surface hydrology and moisture availability that can feedback and influence the total response. Land surface processes are believed to be especially important in spring and summer. Anomalous SSTs and tropical forcing have tended to be strongest in the northern winter, and teleconnections in the southern hemisphere are weaker and more variable and thus more inclined to be masked by natural variability. Occasional strong forcing in seasons other than winter can produce strong and identifiable signals in the northern hemisphere and, because the noise of natural variability is less, the signal-to-noise ratio can be large. The relative importance of tropical versus extratropical SST forcings has been established through numerical experiments with atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). Predictability of anomalous circulation and associated surface temperature and precipitation in the extratropics is somewhat limited by the difficulty of finding a modest signal embedded in the high level of noise from natural variability in the extratropics, and the complexity and variety of the possible feedbacks. Accordingly, ensembles of AGCM runs and time averaging are needed to identify signals and make predictions. Strong anomalous tropical forcing provides opportunities for skillful forecasts, and the accuracy and usefulness of forecasts is expected to improve as the ability to forecast the anomalous SSTs improves, as models improve, and as the information available from the mean and the spread of ensemble forecasts is better utilized.},

	abstract = {The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the main mode of variability in the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropical circulation and it is so called because of its zonally symmetric ring-like shape. However, the SAM pattern actually contains noticeable deviations from zonal symmetry. Thus, the purpose of this study is to describe the zonally asymmetric and symmetric components of the SAM variability and their impacts. We regress monthly geopotential height fields at each level onto the asymmetric and symmetric component of the SAM to create two new indices: Asymmetric SAM (A-SAM) and Symmetric SAM (S-SAM). In the troposphere, the A-SAM is associated with a zonal wave 3 which is rotated a quarter wavelength with respect to the climatological zonal wave 3, is much stronger in the Pacific ocean, where it extends vertically to the stratosphere with an equivalent barotropic structure. On the other hand, the S-SAM is associated with negative geopotential height anomalies over Antarctica surrounded by a zonally symmetric ring of positive geopotential height anomalies. The observed relationship between the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the SAM is fully explained by the A-SAM index. The positive trend of the SAM is present only in its symmetric component. Despite this, the SAM is becoming more zonally asymmetric. The regional impacts of the SAM in temperature and precipitation are strongly affected by its asymmetric component. We show that the asymmetric component of the SAM has its own unique variability, trends and impacts, some of these signals are only evident when the two SAM components are separated.},

	abstract = {We investigate variability and trends of the Southern Hemisphere quasi-stationary planetary waves over 1979–2013 using the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim reanalyses. The effects of tropical and extra-tropical forcing factors on the phase and amplitude of the planetary waves are identified. The amplitudes of wave numbers 1–3 exhibit an annual cycle with a minimum in summer and maximum over the extended austral winter period. The phase of wave number 1 has a semi-annual cycle, moving east in austral spring/autumn and west in summer/winter as a result of differences in the phase of the semi-annual oscillation across the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The phase of wave number 3 has an annual cycle, being more eastward (westward) in summer (winter). Year-to-year variability of the amplitude of wave number 1 is found to be strongly associated with the Amundsen Sea Low, which in turn is known to be strongly influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, with the consequence that the amplitude of wave number 1 is larger during the El Niño phase of the cycle. Regarding trends for the year as a whole, the amplitude of wave number 1 has decreased since 1979 (p {\textless} 0.1), while the amplitudes of wave numbers 2 and 3 have increased. These changes are consistent with the warming trends in sea surface temperatures across much of the tropical oceans. However, the factors associated with longer-term trends are less clear than for year-to-year variability.},

Determining the time of emergence of climate change signals from the natural variability is critical for mitigation strategies and adaptation planning. Here, using a multimodel ensemble, we find that the annual-mean sea surface temperature (SST) signal has already emerged across much of the tropical Pacific, appearing last in the east. The signal of a wetter annual-mean rainfall in the east is expected to emerge by mid-century, with some sensitivity to emission scenario. However, the ENSO-related rainfall variability signal is projected to emerge by about 2040 regardless of emission scenario, about 30 years earlier than ENSO-related SST variability signal at about 2070. Our results are instructive for the detection of climate change signals and reinforce the rapidly emerging risks of ENSO-induced climate extremes regardless of mitigation actions.},

	abstract = {El Niño and La Niña, collectively referred to as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are not only highly consequential1–6 but also strongly nonlinear7–14. For example, the maximum warm anomalies of El Niño, which occur in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean, are larger than the maximum cold anomalies of La Niña, which are centred in the equatorial central Pacific Ocean7–9. The associated atmospheric nonlinear thermal damping cools the equatorial Pacific during El Niño but warms it during La Niña15,16. Under greenhouse warming, climate models project an increase in the frequency of strong El Niño and La Niña events, but the change differs vastly across models17, which is partially attributed to internal variability18–23. Here we show that like a butterfly effect24, an infinitesimal random perturbation to identical initial conditions induces vastly different initial ENSO variability, which systematically affects its response to greenhouse warming a century later. In experiments with higher initial variability, a greater cumulative oceanic heat loss from ENSO thermal damping reduces stratification of the upper equatorial Pacific Ocean, leading to a smaller increase in ENSO variability under subsequent greenhouse warming. This self-modulating mechanism operates in two large ensembles generated using two different models, each commencing from identical initial conditions but with a butterfly perturbation24,25; it also operates in a large ensemble generated with another model commencing from different initial conditions25,26 and across climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project27,28. Thus, if the greenhouse-warming-induced increase in ENSO variability29 is initially suppressed by internal variability, future ENSO variability is likely to be enhanced, and vice versa. This self-modulation linking ENSO variability across time presents a different perspective for understanding the dynamics of ENSO variability on multiple timescales in a changing climate.},
