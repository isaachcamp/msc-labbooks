| Composite | Figure composed of mulitple data fields, combined using a statistical method applied over a number of time steps, e.g. mean of strong ENSO warm events. |
| Extratropical cyclones | Cyclones that form outside of the tropics, often referred to as lows or depressions, with associated cold and warm fronts. They are generally preceded and tailed by high pressure systems or highs. |
| Phase speed | The speed of individual cyclones. |
| Occluded front | When a cold front overtakes a warm front (comes into contact with) resulting in a warm air being lifted. |
| Norwegian cyclone model | Simple model depicting how extratropical cyclones form along a frontal boundary, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_cyclone_model. |
| Convergence zone | Area where two air flows (or air masses) of differing characteristics meet, often resulting in vertical motions. |
| Air mass | A discrete mass of air that has distinct properties, such as density, temperature, pressure etc. |
| Rossby Number | Defines the ratio of inertia to coriolis forces. It is used in scale analyis for diagnosing which forces are important in the governing equations. For synoptic scale weather systems in the mid-latitudes, it is generally small, meaning the coriolis force dominates. |
