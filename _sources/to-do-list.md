# To Do List

## This Week

- Maximum covariance analysis between paired fields (mean height and variance anomalies).
    - Read up on MCA for plotting.
- Document new classes.
- Read up on covariance.
- Document yearly covariance.
- Document seasonal covariance maps.
- Read up on Partial Correlations.
- Read thorugh week 10 nots and check out common features found in maps -- [week 10](era5_analysis/week10.md).
    - Positive over negative? Positive over positive? Vice versa?
    - Consistency between seasons of different phase bins?
    - Spiral-like structure as seen in JJA 0 - 60 degrees?


## Questions to Answer

- Is geostrophic balance the reason why there is momentum convergence in the storm tracks?
- Why does Trenberth 1991 use the covariance of atmospheric variables to determine fluxes of momentum, heat, moisture etc.?
- What is the Eliasson-Palm flux and what does it represent? Trenberth 1991 seems to use E-P flux as a proxy for representing eddy fluxes of several characteristics of storms.
- The jet axis tends to be located above a narrow sloping zone of strong potential temperature gradients, called the _polar-frontal zone_, which separates the cold polar air from the warm tropical air. This is a result of the thermal wind balance. Why is this?
