## On the Dynamics of a Storm Track, Chang & Orlanski, 1993 {cite}`chang_dynamics_1993`

Highlight the importance ageostrophic geopotential fluxes in forming regions of strong cyclogenesis, and of baroclinic and barotropic conversion of energy. They suggest this shifts the maximum in storm frequency much further downstream than if it were due to proximity to maximum baroclinicity.

Enhanced diabatic heating off the east coast of continents, downstream, due to the relatively warm ocean creates regions of maximum baroclinicity.


## Seasonal Zonal Asymmetries in the Southern Annular Mode and Their Impact on Regional Temperature Anomalies, Fogt et al. 2012 {cite}`fogt_seasonal_2012`

The authors highlight the importance of considering the seasonal cycle when studying the SAM, particularly due to the strong seasonality of the asymmetrical component of the SAM in the Pacific.

They find, by removing the time and zonal means leaving the residual persistent asymmetries, there is consistently a region over the Amundsen Sea in SAM+ composites. Less regularly in SAM-- composites, but SON expresses a particularly strong ASL.

Key findings:
    - SAM most asymmetric in winter and spring.
    - There is a negative trend in asymmetry during summer and autumn, i.e., the SAM is becoming more symmetric during these seasons.
    - Asymmetric component explains a significant proportion of variability in the SAM, up to 25%.
    - Strongly ties A-SAM with ENSO (see also {cite}`campitelli_assessment_2022`).
    - A-SAM component associated with variations in jet entrance and exit regions in the Pacific, as well as undergoing strong forcing from storms in the Pacific. Whereas the rest of the SAM has fairly zonally symmetric forcing from storms.

    
## Decadal Variability of the ENSO Teleconnection to the High-Latitude South Pacific Governed by Coupling with the Southern Annular Mode, Fogt & Bromwich 2006 {cite}`fogt_decadal_2006`

Observations of significant decadal variability noted in previous studies motivate this study. Between the 1980s and 1990s, there was a change in the PSA teleconnection pattern -- in the '80s, it is weak and zonally elongated compared to the '90s. Only the SON and DJF display statistically significant regions, months when either the teleconnection is best propagated or when ENSO events are at their peak, therefore only these seasons were considered. The study shows that when SAM and ENSO are in phase, the ENSO teleconnection is much stronger in the Southern Ocean and over Antarctica.

Mo and Higgins (1998) identify two PSA patterns, look into their paper, as these seem to appear in our MCA results.

Mo and Peagle (2001) connect the PSA mode associated with each ENSO event with 
the position of tropical convection events -- a possible link to EP and CP event
ENSO types?

They perform an EOF analysis on 500hPa height field and find the PSA1 and PSA2 patterns emerge as the second and third EOFs after the SAM.
