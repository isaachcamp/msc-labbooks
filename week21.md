### Observed Patterns of Month-to-Month Storm-Track Variability and Their Relationship to the Background Flow {cite}`wettstein_observed_2009`

Associates monthly storm track variability with dominant patterns of 300hPa meridional wind (which they seem to use as the proxy for the storm track, appears to max out at the same latitude, in between mean height field maxima and minima), Z500 and 850hPa meridional heat flux fields. Finds correlations between NH teleconnective patterns and dominant EOF projections from one or other of the three fields invesigated. Considers two main modes of variability associated with the storm track, "pulsing" -- variation in strength of the storm track -- and latitudinal shifting. Also identifies the depth to which the patterns and modes of variability extend through the troposphere, finding that they tend to extend from sea level to the top of the troposphere. They suggest that the modes of variability are associated with changes to the climatological-mean upper tropospheric jet stream.

They use sector-segmented EOFs and PCs that isolate variability in that sector alone, and find that much more variance is explained (not necessariliy surprising, but the difference is significant, e.g., 77% up from 9% in the leading EOF of the SH). Applying this method could find similar results for our results, particularly when trying to correlate the SOI with a PC in MCA, as the field response seems to be largely local -- Wettstein and Wallace term this 'hemispheric incoherence'. This is more relevant for the NH however, and this study doesn't make conclusions about whether the SAM modulates storm track variability on a hemispheric scale, whereas our analysis certainly seems to indicate that.

### Variability of the Observed Midlatitude Storm Tracks in Relation to Low-Frequency Changes in the Circulation Pattern {cite}`lau_variability_1988`

Correlation between PCs of Z500 and Northen Hemisphere teleconnection patterns. This paper takes correlations between the PCs of the EOF analysis and indices for the teleconnective patterns, as we did with the SOI, can reference this paper as a legitimatisation of our method.
