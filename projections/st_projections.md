# Storm Track Projections

## Enhanced poleward propagation of storms under climate change {cite}`tamarin-brodsky_enhanced_2017`

The authors also identify a storm track poleward shift in the NH and SH from CMIP5 models. They suggest this is related to characteristics of individual storms, where enhanced advection of the upper-level winds due to intensification of upper-level flow, and greater tropical convection due to enhanced convergence at lower levels as a result of greater absolute humidity in a warmer atmosphere. They suggest both of these mechanisms work in tandem with other possible mechanisms to increase the poleward propagation of storms.
