# CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)

## The ScenarioMIP for CMIP6 {cite}`oneill_scenario_2016`

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the organising framework under which CMIP6 multi-model projections are made, and forms the basis for studies into climatic changes and resilience, mitigation and adaptation best practices. Predetermined scenarios have been outlined encompassing a number of variables, including emissions and land use changes. Scenarios are composed of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) -- assumed narratives of societal development and their implications on climate -- and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) -- a net budget of incoming and outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere known as radiative forcing, which also encompasses climate mitigation policy. SSPs are described in qualitative terms, such as investment in education, and translated into quantitative measures that can be interpreted by ESMs, such as population growth and urbanisation. 

The two scenarios investigated in this study are SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. Both assume similar societal evolution in that they assume strong investment in health and education. Wheras SSP5 assumes technologically advanced fossil-fueled development to drive up human captial and adaptative capabilities, SSP1 assumes a sustainable future with a shift in emphasis of the economy to human well-being, reducing inequality between and within nations. The result being a future of high emissions versus one of low emissions, creating two vastly different scenarios that should highlight the disparities between the two in the state of the Earth's climate {cite}`riahi_shared_2017`.


## Sensitivity of Regional Climate to Global Temperature and Forcing {cite}`tebaldi_sensitivity_2015`

Global average quantities fail to convey the synoptic extremes that have real impact on human lives and livelihoods. Therefore, understanding how global quantities connect to those on the regional level is important. {cite}`tebaldi_sensitivity_2015` use an extensive database of model realisations and find a rise in global average temperature of 0.3Â°C results in statistically significant changes at regional scales. Scenarios were differentiated along these lines, ensuring each lead to statistically distinct outcomes.
