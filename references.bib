	abstract = {The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of extratropical Southern Hemisphere climate variability, associated with changes in the strength and position of the polar jet around Antarctica. This variability in the polar jet drives large fluctuations in the Southern Hemisphere climate, from the lower stratosphere into the troposphere, and stretching from the midlatitudes across the Southern Ocean to Antarctica. Notably, the SAM index has displayed marked positive trends in the austral summer season (stronger and poleward shifted westerlies), associated with stratospheric ozone loss. Historical reconstructions demonstrate that these recent positive SAM index values are unprecedented in the last millennia, and fall outside the range of natural climate variability. Despite these advances in the understanding of the SAM behavior, several areas of active research are identified that highlight gaps in our present knowledge.

	abstract = {Abstract An observed trend in the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) during recent decades has involved an intensification of the polar vortex. The source of this trend is a matter of scientific debate with stratospheric ozone losses, greenhouse gas increases, and natural variability all being possible contenders. Because it is difficult to separate the contribution of various external forcings to the observed trend, a state-of-the-art global coupled model is utilized here. Ensembles of twentieth-century simulations forced with the observed time series of greenhouse gases, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, sulfate aerosols, volcanic aerosols, solar variability, and various combinations of these are used to examine the annular mode trends in comparison to observations, in an attempt to isolate the response of the climate system to each individual forcing. It is found that ozone changes are the biggest contributor to the observed summertime intensification of the southern polar vortex in the second half of the twentieth century, with increases of greenhouse gases also being a necessary factor in the reproduction of the observed trends at the surface. Although stratospheric ozone losses are expected to stabilize and eventually recover to preindustrial levels over the course of the twenty-first century, these results show that increasing greenhouse gases will continue to intensify the polar vortex throughout the twenty-first century, but that radiative forcing will cause widespread temperature increases over the entire Southern Hemisphere.},

	abstract = {Abstract A detailed view of Southern Hemisphere storm tracks is obtained based on the application of filtered variance and modern feature-tracking techniques to a wide range of 45-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. It has been checked that the conclusions drawn in this study are valid even if data from only the satellite era are used. The emphasis of the paper is on the winter season, but results for the four seasons are also discussed. Both upper- and lower-tropospheric fields are used. The tracking analysis focuses on systems that last longer than 2 days and are mobile (move more than 1000 km). Many of the results support previous ideas about the storm tracks, but some new insights are also obtained. In the summer there is a rather circular, strong, deep high-latitude storm track. In winter the high-latitude storm track is more asymmetric with a spiral from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in toward Antarctica and a subtropical jet–related lower-latitude storm track over the Pacific, again tending to spiral poleward. At all times of the year, maximum storm activity in the higher-latitude storm track is in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions. In the winter upper troposphere, the relative importance of, and interplay between, the subtropical and subpolar storm tracks is discussed. The genesis, lysis, and growth rate of lower-tropospheric winter cyclones together lead to a vivid picture of their behavior that is summarized as a set of overlapping plates, each composed of cyclone life cycles. Systems in each plate appear to feed the genesis in the next plate through downstream development in the upper-troposphere spiral storm track. In the lee of the Andes in South America, there is cyclogenesis associated with the subtropical jet and also, poleward of this, cyclogenesis largely associated with system decay on the upslope and regeneration on the downslope. The genesis and lysis of cyclones and anticyclones have a definite spatial relationship with each other and with the Andes. At 500 hPa, their relative longitudinal positions are consistent with vortex-stretching ideas for simple flow over a large-scale mountain. Cyclonic systems near Antarctica have generally spiraled in from lower latitudes. However, cyclogenesis associated with mobile cyclones occurs around the Antarctic coast with an interesting genesis maximum over the sea ice near 150°E. The South Pacific storm track emerges clearly from the tracking as a coherent deep feature spiraling from Australia to southern South America. A feature of the summer season is the genesis of eastward-moving cyclonic systems near the tropic of Capricorn off Brazil, in the central Pacific and, to a lesser extent, off Madagascar, followed by movement along the southwest flanks of the subtropical anticyclones and contribution to the “convergence zone” cloud bands seen in these regions.},

It considers motions with horizontal scales of hundreds of kilometers or longer, vertical scales on the order of the depth of the troposphere, and timescales on the order of a day or longer. Motions on these scales are directly and strongly influenced by the Earth's rotation, they are in hydrostatic balance, and the vertical component of the three-dimensional velocity vector is more than three orders of smaller magnitude than the horizontal component but is nonetheless of critical importance. The chapter also introduces some concepts and definitions that are useful in characterizing horizontal flow patterns. It is followed by a more extensive review on the dynamics of large-scale horizontal motions on a rotating planet. The chapter further introduces the system of primitive equations, which is widely used for predicting how large-scale motions evolve with time. The chapter concludes with brief discussions on the atmospheric general circulation and numerical weather prediction.},

	abstract = {Rainfall that sustains life on Earth is not the bounty of cloud microphysical processes alone. Without vigorous and sustained motions, the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle would stagnate. Much of the ascent that drives the hydrologic cycle in the Earth's atmosphere occurs in association with weather systems with well-defined structures and life cycles. A small fraction of these systems achieve the status of storms capable of disrupting human activities and, in some instances, inflicting damage. This chapter introduces the structure and underlying dynamics of weather systems and their associated weather phenomena. The chapter deals with large-scale extratropical weather systems (baroclinic waves and the associated extratropical cyclones) and their embedded mesoscale fronts. It discusses some of the effects of terrain on large-scale weather systems and some of the associated weather phenomena. It describes the modes of mesoscale organization of deep cumulus convection and a special form of organization in which a mesoscale convective system acquires strong rotation. These tropical cyclones tend to be tighter, more axially symmetric, and more intense than their extratropical counterparts.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores the fascinating behavior of the boundary layer and the turbulent motions within it. The Earth's surface is the bottom boundary of the atmosphere. The portion of the atmosphere most affected by that boundary is called the atmospheric boundary layer or boundary layer for short. The thickness of the boundary layer is quite variable in space and time. Turbulence and static stability conspire to sandwich a strong stable layer called a capping inversion between the boundary layer below and the rest of the troposphere above called the free atmosphere. This stable layer traps turbulence, pollutants, and moisture below it and prevents most of the surface friction from being felt by the free atmosphere. Turbulence is ubiquitous within the boundary layer and is responsible for efficiently dispersing the pollutants that accompany modern life. Turbulent communication between the surface and the air is quite rapid, allowing the air to quickly take on characteristics of the underlying surface. In fact, one definition of the boundary layer is that portion of the lower troposphere that feels the effects of the underlying surface within about 30 min or less. Turbulence is inspiringly complex, consisting of a superposition of swirls called “eddies” that interact nonlinearly to create quasi-random, chaotic motions. An infinite number of equations are required to fully describe these motions. Hence, a complete solution has not been found.},

	abstract = {Abstract In a zonally symmetric climatology with a single eddy-driven jet, such as prevails in the Southern Hemisphere summer, the midlatitude variability is dominated by fluctuations of the jet around its mean position, as described by the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM). To study whether this result holds for a zonally asymmetric climatology, the observed variability of the Southern Hemisphere winter is analyzed. The mean state in this case is characterized by relatively weak stationary waves; yet there exist significant zonal variations in the mean strength and meridional structure of the subtropical jet stream. As in summer, the winter SAM signature is annular in shape and the corresponding wind anomalies are dipolar; but it is associated with two different behaviors of the eddy-driven jet in different longitudinal ranges. Over the Indian Ocean, the SAM is associated primarily with a latitudinal shift of the jet around its mean position. Over the Pacific sector, it is instead characterized by a seesaw in the wind speed between two distinct latitudes, corresponding to the positions of the midlatitude and subtropical jets. Composites of eddy forcing and baroclinicity over both sectors appear consistent with the two different behaviors. As in the zonal-mean case, high-frequency eddies both force and maintain the low-frequency wind anomalies associated with the SAM. The positive feedback by eddies is, however, not local: changes in the eddy forcing are influenced most strongly by zonal wind anomalies located upstream.},

	abstract = {Abstract From 1979 to 1989, global European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses of many meteorological variables important in baroclinic storms have been bandpass filtered to highlight fluctuations on 2- to 8-day time scales in order to illuminate the relationships among the variables in baroclinic storm-track regions. Because of the greater zonal symmetry in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) versus the Northern Hemisphere (NH), it is possible to examine these relationships over a zonal sector without being dominated by local effects associated with jet stream entrance and exit regions of the storm tracks. The bandpassed variance of geopotential height is used to define the storm track, and its meridional profile has a pronounced midlatitude maximum in the SH. The locations of the jet stream and the variance maxima of meridional and zonal velocity components, vorticity, vertical motion, specific humidity, and temperature all bear a distinctive relationship to the storm track, but the latitudes of their maxima are displaced from the center of the storm track. Many covariance quantities such as the transient eddy temperature, moisture, vorticity, and vertical and horizontal momentum fluxes also exhibit a strong storm-track signature. The observed relationships among the eddy quantities can generally be understood in terms of geostrophic theory and perturbation analysis applied to baroclinic systems. Storm-track activity is remarkably persistent throughout the year in both location and intensity in the SH. The storm track is farthest poleward in the transition seasons as part of a semiannual cycle, but remains near 50°S year round, and is strongest in the southern Indian Ocean and weakest in the South Pacific. There is a strong relationship between the storm track and the major tropospheric polar jet stream and its associated lower-level baroclinicity throughout the year, and the distribution of storm-track activity can be accounted for by baroclinic theory. In contrast to the NH, strongest meridional temperature gradients in middle latitudes are found in the summer half-year in the SH. Whereas the NH storm-track activity is much weaker in summer and shifts poleward, the SH activity is as strong as in winter and, if anything, shifts slightly equatorward. The zonal symmetry is greater in summer and meridional profiles are sharper, implying less variability in the storm track both within and between seasons. In winter, high-frequency storm-track activity extends over a broader range of latitudes and continues to be mainly associated with the polar jet stream. The question of the impact of the storm-track eddies on the mean flow is examined using zonal mean and a localized Eliassen–Palm flux. Baroclinic effects from the poleward heat flux dominate in winter and the eddies act to decelerate the upper tropospheric westerlies. Barotropic effects in the upper troposphere, mostly from the meridional momentum flux convergence, help to maintain the mean westerly distribution by accelerating the main polar jet and maintaining the mean split in the flow near New Zealand in both summer and winter and even dominate the baroclinic component in the storm track in summer. Diabatic heating by the eddies may also help maintain the mean flow.},

	abstract = {Abstract An objective method is developed and used to derive a climatology of centers of cyclonic vorticity for the Southern Hemisphere, based on twice-daily European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 1000-hPa analyses during 1980–86. These centers were computed as local minima of geostrophic relative vorticity ζg, extending previous studies based on pressure minima. This use of ζg, avoids a bias favoring slower and/or deeper cyclones that occurs when pressure is used and includes a large number of additional mobile vorticity centers in the 45°–55°S band that are missed where a local pressure minimum cannot be found. An automated tracking algorithm similar to that of Murray and Simmonds is used to match predicted location, pressure, and ζg from previous track history with available centers. Large numbers of ζg centers were found south of 60°S and near the midlatitude continents, as in previous studies. These were a mixture of migratory centers and other fixed topographic features. The maxima around Antarctica may include many spurious centers that are artifacts of a fictitious surface anticyclone over the elevated continent. Maxima around East Antarctica were located near katabatic-prone stations. Large counts near the three midiatitude landmasses were mostly heat lows and lee troughs. These stationary orographic features were eliminated to retain just the traveling disturbances that dominate the weather and climate of the region. These mobile centers were distributed much more uniformly. When centers were counted just once per grid square per cyclone, the resulting “track density” maximized year-round in a belt near 50°S rather than within the cyclone “graveyard” of the circumpolar trough, in good agreement with baroclinic storm tracks obtained elsewhere from eddy statistics. A second maximum associated with the subtropical jet was found during winter and spring near 40°S in the New Zealand-Pacific sector. Intense cyclones, stratified by ζg, occurred most frequently in winter near New Zealand, east of South America, and in the southern Indian Ocean. An apparent increase in cyclone numbers in early 1933 coincided with the introduction of envelope orography at the ECMWF.},

Prior smoothing of the raw data with a constant radius spatial filter is used to remove distortions related to the particular grid configuration used and to consistently admit a known scale of disturbance over the domain. Pitfalls of using central pressure or vorticity to infer cyclone intensity are illustrated, and a procedure for obtaining a more realistic areal measure of circulation is described. An automated selection procedure for storms having specific properties is outlined. Case selection is by computer search of a database of cyclone tracks, obtained from an application of the cyclone finding and tracking procedure to an extended series of gridded mean sea level pressure analyses. A selection of winter season cyclone statistics for both hemispheres is obtained from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses. Discrepancies with and between earlier studies appear more related to differing cyclone detection and counting procedures than to any intrinsic variability in analysis quality or cyclone occurrence. Results are found in agreement with the widely accepted manually produced climatologies only when a similar cyclone counting procedure is used. As in previous studies, Northern Hemisphere cyclones form and intensify near the eastern seaboards of Asia and North America, with maximum activity near SST gradients. They move eastward and poleward during their lives before weakening in the Gulf of Alaska and near Iceland. Southern Hemisphere cyclones are more evenly distributed around the hemisphere. They tend to form and intensify in middle latitudes, near SST gradients over open oceans, and near the eastern coasts of South America and Australia, and decay at higher latitudes. There is some evidence that newly formed and intensifying cyclones in both hemispheres possess a tighter inner structure than mature and decaying systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Southern Hemisphere mid- to upper-tropospheric planetary wave activity is characterized by the superposition of two zonally oriented, quasi-stationary waveforms: zonal wavenumber 1 (ZW1) and zonal wavenumber 3 (ZW3). Previous studies have tended to consider these waveforms in isolation and with the exception of those studies relating to sea ice, little is known about their impact on regional climate variability. A novel approach is taken to quantifying the combined influence of ZW1 and ZW3, using the strength of the hemispheric meridional flow as a proxy for zonal wave activity. The methodology adapts the wave envelope construct routinely used in the identification of synoptic-scale Rossby wave packets and improves on existing approaches by allowing for variations in both wave phase and amplitude. While ZW1 and ZW3 are both prominent features of the climatological circulation, the defining feature of highly meridional hemispheric states is an enhancement of the ZW3 component. Composites of the mean surface conditions during these highly meridional, ZW3-like anomalous states (i.e., months of strong planetary wave activity) reveal large sea ice anomalies over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas during autumn and along much of the East Antarctic coastline throughout the year. Large precipitation anomalies in regions of significant topography (e.g., New Zealand, Patagonia, and coastal Antarctica) and anomalously warm temperatures over much of the Antarctic continent were also associated with strong planetary wave activity. The latter has potentially important implications for the interpretation of recent warming over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.},

	abstract = {A distinctive feature of the Southern Hemisphere extratropical atmospheric circulation is the quasi-stationary zonal wave 3 pattern. This pattern is present in both the mean atmospheric circulation and its variability on daily, seasonal and interannual timescales. While the zonal wave 3 pattern has substantial impacts on meridional heat transport and Antarctic sea ice extent, the reason for its existence remains uncertain, although it has long been assumed to be linked to the presence of three major landmasses in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Here we use an atmospheric general circulation model to show that the stationary zonal wave 3 pattern is instead driven by zonally asymmetric deep convection in the tropics, with little influence from extratropical orography or landmasses. Localized regions of deep convection in the tropics form a local Hadley cell, which in turn creates a wave source in the subtropics that excites a poleward- and eastward-propagating wave train, forming quasi-stationary waves in the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes. Our findings suggest that changes in tropical deep convection, either due to natural variability or climate change, fundamentally control the zonal wave 3 pattern, with implications for southern high-latitude climate, ocean circulation and sea ice.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study examines the month-to-month variations in the tracks of Southern Hemisphere weather systems and their relation to low-frequency circulation variability. Cyclones and anticyclones are identified and tracked from ECMWF analyses during 1980–94 via an automated method and the principal patterns of variation identified by EOF analysis of monthly track density anomaly fields. Only the first three EOFs of cyclone track density involving about one-third of the total track variance were distinguishable from noise. Spatial patterns derived from both unrotated and rotated EOF analysis were not reproducible on subsets of the data, pointing to secular changes in the variance structure of the cyclone dataset. An increase in cyclone numbers over the Southern Ocean during the 1980s suggested that detection of small-scale cyclones is sensitive to changes in data coverage and analysis procedure, as associated changes in the mean circulation were small during this period. EOFs of anticyclone track data were found to be more robust, indicating a variety of seesaw patterns across the hemisphere. The leading modes of sea level pressure variability are found to be associated with regional variations in cyclone and anticyclone activity. The first pressure EOF, the so-called high-latitude mode, modulates cyclone activity between middle and high latitudes, with increased (decreased) westerlies near 55°–56°S accompanied by more (fewer) cyclones in the circumpolar regions and fewer (more) in middle latitudes. The second and third EOFs have centers of action near 60°S, 120°W and 55°S, 165°W, respectively, and are linked with blocking activity in these two regions. Blocks in the New Zealand sector occur in conjunction with a zonal wavenumber 3 pattern, while southeast Pacific blocks have no significant correlations outside the Pacific. A coherent cyclone response to ENSO was also found. During El Niño winters, increased cyclone activity occurs in a band spiraling southeastward from the subtropical Pacific toward South America, while fewer cyclones are found across the subtropical Indian Ocean, Australasia, and the southwest Pacific. During La Niñas, these patterns are almost exactly reversed, suggesting a predominantly linear cyclone response to ENSO.},

Generating SH cyclone tracks from global reanalysis datasets is problematic due to data reliability, especially prior to 1979. It is therefore prudent to compare the climatology and variability of SH cyclone tracks from different reanalysis datasets. We generate cyclone track frequency and intensity climatologies from three reanalysis datasets: The National Center for Environmental Prediction’s Reanalysis I and Reanalysis II datasets and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ERA-40 dataset. Our results show that ERA-40 produces more intense cyclones in the SH active cyclone region compared to NCEP reanalyses. More intense storms are also found in the SH active cyclone region in NCEP reanalyses data post-1979 reflecting the positive trend in the AAO in the past few decades. When evaluating interannual variability, our results show Rossby wave trains including the Pacific South American (PSA) and the East Indian Ocean pattern in response to anomalous heating linked to El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), respectively. Response to the AAO shows a robust annular structure for cyclone track frequency, but not intensity suggesting a weak relationship between cyclone frequency and cyclone intensity.},

This study has been conducted with a two-level primitive equation eigenvalue model and the growing modes for both January and July averaged basic states are examined. In both seasons, the fastest-growing cyclogenesis modes have largest amplitudes in the eastern part of the hemisphere just downstream of the polar jet stream maxima. In July, there is a tendency to form elongated eddies in the region downstream of Australia where growth on both polar and subtropical jet streams occurs. These results are in general agreement with the observational studies of Southern Hemisphere storm tracks. For both January and July, larger-scale slower-propagating dipole or multipole modes are found that are consistent with blocking in some or all of the observed locations in the Australian/New Zealand region, east of the Falklands, and to the southeast of South Africa. The faster-growing low-frequency anomaly modes have their primary centers located to the south of 60°S and have features in common with either or both of high-latitude and wavenumber 3 observed Southern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns or, to a lesser extent, with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation anomaly patterns for 1982–1983.

	abstract = {Abstract The association between Southern Hemisphere cyclones and anticyclones and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), southern annular mode (SAM), Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE), and rainfall in Perth and Melbourne is explored. Those cities are, respectively, located in the southwestern and southeastern corners of Australia, where substantial decreasing rainfall trends have been observed over the last decades. The need for a more unified understanding of large-scale anomalies in storm indicators associated with the climate features itemized above has motivated this study. The main aim is to identify cyclone-anomalous areas that are potentially important in characterizing continental rainfall anomalies from a hemispheric perspective, focusing on midlatitude Australia. The study covers the “satellite era” from 1979 to 2003 and was conducted for the southern winter when midlatitude rainfall is predominantly baroclinic. The results indicate a well-organized hemispheric cyclone pattern associated with ENSO, SAM, SIE, and rainfall anomalies. There is a moderate large-scale, high-latitude resemblance between La Niña, negative SAM, and reduced SIE in some sectors. In particular, there is a suggestion that SIE anomalies over the Indian Ocean and Western Australia sectors are associated with a large-scale pattern of cyclone/anticyclone anomalies that is more pronounced over the longitudes of Australia and New Zealand. Spatial correlation analysis suggests a robust link between cyclone density over the sectors mentioned above and rainfall in Perth and Melbourne. Statistical analyses of rainfall and SIE show modest correlations for Perth and weak correlations for Melbourne, generally corroborating the above. It is proposed that SAM and SIE are part of a complex physical system that is best understood as a coupled mechanism, and that their impacts on the circulation can be seen as partially independent of ENSO. While SAM and SIE have greater influence on the circulation affecting rainfall in the western side of Australia, ENSO is the dominant influence on the eastern half of the country. A contraction of the sea ice seems to be accompanied by a southward shift of high-latitude cyclones, which is also hypothesized to increase downstream cyclone density at midlatitudes via conservation of mass, similarly to what is observed during the extreme positive phase of the SAM. These associations build on previous developments in the literature. They bring a more unified view on high-latitude climate features, and may also help to explain the declining trends in Australian rainfall.},

	abstract = {The primary focus of this review is tropical-extratropical interactions and especially the issues involved in determining the response of the extratropical atmosphere to tropical forcing associated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The review encompasses observations, empirical studies, theory and modeling of the extratropical teleconnections with a focus on developments over the Tropical Oceans-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) decade and the current state of understanding. In the tropical atmosphere, anomalous SSTs force anomalies in convection and large-scale overturning with subsidence in the descending branch of the local Hadley circulation. The resulting strong upper tropospheric divergence in the tropics and convergence in the subtropics act as a Rossby wave source. The climatological stationary planetary waves and associated jet streams, especially in the northern hemisphere, can make the total Rossby wave sources somewhat insensitive to the position of the tropical heating that induces them and thus can create preferred teleconnection response patterns, such as the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. However, a number of factors influence the dispersion and propagation of Rossby waves through the atmosphere, including zonal asymmetries in the climatological state, transients, and baroclinic and nonlinear effects. Internal midlatitude sources can amplify perturbations. Observations, modeling, and theory have clearly shown how storm tracks change in response to changes in quasi-stationary waves and how these changes generally feedback to maintain or strengthen the dominant perturbations through vorticity and momentum transports. The response of the extratropical atmosphere naturally induces changes in the underlying surface, so that there are changes in extratropical SSTs and changes in land surface hydrology and moisture availability that can feedback and influence the total response. Land surface processes are believed to be especially important in spring and summer. Anomalous SSTs and tropical forcing have tended to be strongest in the northern winter, and teleconnections in the southern hemisphere are weaker and more variable and thus more inclined to be masked by natural variability. Occasional strong forcing in seasons other than winter can produce strong and identifiable signals in the northern hemisphere and, because the noise of natural variability is less, the signal-to-noise ratio can be large. The relative importance of tropical versus extratropical SST forcings has been established through numerical experiments with atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). Predictability of anomalous circulation and associated surface temperature and precipitation in the extratropics is somewhat limited by the difficulty of finding a modest signal embedded in the high level of noise from natural variability in the extratropics, and the complexity and variety of the possible feedbacks. Accordingly, ensembles of AGCM runs and time averaging are needed to identify signals and make predictions. Strong anomalous tropical forcing provides opportunities for skillful forecasts, and the accuracy and usefulness of forecasts is expected to improve as the ability to forecast the anomalous SSTs improves, as models improve, and as the information available from the mean and the spread of ensemble forecasts is better utilized.},

	abstract = {The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the main mode of variability in the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropical circulation and it is so called because of its zonally symmetric ring-like shape. However, the SAM pattern actually contains noticeable deviations from zonal symmetry. Thus, the purpose of this study is to describe the zonally asymmetric and symmetric components of the SAM variability and their impacts. We regress monthly geopotential height fields at each level onto the asymmetric and symmetric component of the SAM to create two new indices: Asymmetric SAM (A-SAM) and Symmetric SAM (S-SAM). In the troposphere, the A-SAM is associated with a zonal wave 3 which is rotated a quarter wavelength with respect to the climatological zonal wave 3, is much stronger in the Pacific ocean, where it extends vertically to the stratosphere with an equivalent barotropic structure. On the other hand, the S-SAM is associated with negative geopotential height anomalies over Antarctica surrounded by a zonally symmetric ring of positive geopotential height anomalies. The observed relationship between the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the SAM is fully explained by the A-SAM index. The positive trend of the SAM is present only in its symmetric component. Despite this, the SAM is becoming more zonally asymmetric. The regional impacts of the SAM in temperature and precipitation are strongly affected by its asymmetric component. We show that the asymmetric component of the SAM has its own unique variability, trends and impacts, some of these signals are only evident when the two SAM components are separated.},

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

The effects of tropical and extra-tropical forcing factors on the phase and amplitude of the planetary waves are identified. The amplitudes of wave numbers 1–3 exhibit an annual cycle with a minimum in summer and maximum over the extended austral winter period. The phase of wave number 1 has a semi-annual cycle, moving east in austral spring/autumn and west in summer/winter as a result of differences in the phase of the semi-annual oscillation across the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The phase of wave number 3 has an annual cycle, being more eastward (westward) in summer (winter). Year-to-year variability of the amplitude of wave number 1 is found to be strongly associated with the Amundsen Sea Low, which in turn is known to be strongly influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, with the consequence that the amplitude of wave number 1 is larger during the El Niño phase of the cycle. Regarding trends for the year as a whole, the amplitude of wave number 1 has decreased since 1979 (p {\textless} 0.1), while the amplitudes of wave numbers 2 and 3 have increased. These changes are consistent with the warming trends in sea surface temperatures across much of the tropical oceans. However, the factors associated with longer-term trends are less clear than for year-to-year variability.},

Determining the time of emergence of climate change signals from the natural variability is critical for mitigation strategies and adaptation planning. Here, using a multimodel ensemble, we find that the annual-mean sea surface temperature (SST) signal has already emerged across much of the tropical Pacific, appearing last in the east. The signal of a wetter annual-mean rainfall in the east is expected to emerge by mid-century, with some sensitivity to emission scenario. However, the ENSO-related rainfall variability signal is projected to emerge by about 2040 regardless of emission scenario, about 30 years earlier than ENSO-related SST variability signal at about 2070. Our results are instructive for the detection of climate change signals and reinforce the rapidly emerging risks of ENSO-induced climate extremes regardless of mitigation actions.},

	abstract = {El Niño and La Niña, collectively referred to as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are not only highly consequential1–6 but also strongly nonlinear7–14. For example, the maximum warm anomalies of El Niño, which occur in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean, are larger than the maximum cold anomalies of La Niña, which are centred in the equatorial central Pacific Ocean7–9. The associated atmospheric nonlinear thermal damping cools the equatorial Pacific during El Niño but warms it during La Niña15,16. Under greenhouse warming, climate models project an increase in the frequency of strong El Niño and La Niña events, but the change differs vastly across models17, which is partially attributed to internal variability18–23. Here we show that like a butterfly effect24, an infinitesimal random perturbation to identical initial conditions induces vastly different initial ENSO variability, which systematically affects its response to greenhouse warming a century later. In experiments with higher initial variability, a greater cumulative oceanic heat loss from ENSO thermal damping reduces stratification of the upper equatorial Pacific Ocean, leading to a smaller increase in ENSO variability under subsequent greenhouse warming. This self-modulating mechanism operates in two large ensembles generated using two different models, each commencing from identical initial conditions but with a butterfly perturbation24,25; it also operates in a large ensemble generated with another model commencing from different initial conditions25,26 and across climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project27,28. Thus, if the greenhouse-warming-induced increase in ENSO variability29 is initially suppressed by internal variability, future ENSO variability is likely to be enhanced, and vice versa. This self-modulation linking ENSO variability across time presents a different perspective for understanding the dynamics of ENSO variability on multiple timescales in a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) is the dominant mode of climate variability in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere. Representing variations in pressure and the corresponding changes to the circumpolar zonal flow, it is typically thought of as an “annular” or ringlike structure. However, on seasonal time scales the zonal symmetry observed in the SAM in monthly or annual mean data is much less marked. This study further examines the seasonal changes in the SAM structure and explores temperature signals across the Southern Hemisphere that are strongly tied to the asymmetric SAM structure. The SAM asymmetries are most marked in the Pacific sector and in austral winter and spring, related to changes in the jet entrance and exit regions poleward of 30°S. Depending on the season, the asymmetric SAM structure explains over 25\% of the variance in the overall SAM structure and has strong connections with ENSO or zonal wavenumber 3. In austral summer and autumn the SAM has been becoming more zonally symmetric, especially after 1980, perhaps tied to changes in anthropogenic forcing. Across the Pacific sector, including the Antarctic Peninsula, temperature variations are strongly tied to the asymmetric SAM structure, while temperatures across East Antarctica are more strongly tied to the zonally symmetric SAM structure. The results suggest that studies examining the climate impacts of the SAM across the Southern Hemisphere need to consider the seasonal variations in the SAM structure as well as varying impacts between its positive and negative polarity to adequately describe the underlying relationships.},

The state of the storm tracks from 1979 to 2014 is compared to that in ERA5 using a Lagrangian objective cyclone tracking algorithm. It is found that the main biases present in the previous generation of models (CMIP5) still persist, albeit to a lesser extent. The equatorward bias around the SH is much reduced and there appears to be some improvement in mean biases with the higher-resolution models, such as the zonal tilt of the North Atlantic storm track. Low-resolution models have a tendency to underestimate the frequency of high-intensity cyclones with all models simulating a peak intensity that is too low for cyclones in the SH. Explosively developing cyclones are underestimated across all ocean basins and in both hemispheres. In particular the models struggle to capture the rapid deepening required for these cyclones. For all measures, the CMIP6 models exhibit an overall improvement compared to the previous generation of CMIP5 models. In the NH most improvements can be attributed to increased horizontal resolution, whereas in the SH the impact of resolution is less apparent and any improvements are likely a result of improved model physics.},

We align Bayesian model evidence (BME) with relative entropy and cross entropy in order to simplify computations using prior-based (Monte Carlo) or posterior-based (Markov chain Monte Carlo) BME estimates. On the one hand, we demonstrate how Bayesian model selection can profit from information theory to estimate BME values via posterior-based techniques. Hence, we use various assumptions including relations to several information criteria. On the other hand, we demonstrate how relative entropy can profit from BME to assess information entropy during Bayesian updating and to assess utility in Bayesian experimental design. Specifically, we emphasize that relative entropy can be computed avoiding unnecessary multidimensional integration from both prior and posterior-based sampling techniques. Prior-based computation does not require any assumptions, however posterior-based estimates require at least one assumption. We illustrate the performance of the discussed estimates of BME, information entropy and experiment utility using a transparent, non-linear example. The multivariate Gaussian posterior estimate includes least assumptions and shows the best performance for BME estimation, information entropy and experiment utility from posterior-based sampling.},

A few examples of the applications are described: entropy in independent components analysis (ICA) and in blind source separation, Fisher information in data model selection, different maximum entropy-based methods in time series spectral estimation and in linear inverse problems and, finally, the Bayesian inference for general inverse problems. Some original materials concerning the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and, in particular, the variational Bayesian approximation (VBA) methods are also presented.

The leading EOF of the zonal-mean zonal wind is well separated from the remaining EOFs and represents the north–south movement of the midlatitude jet. Analysis of the momentum budget shows that a positive feedback between the zonal-mean wind anomalies and the eddy momentum fluxes accounts for the unusual persistence of EOF1 and plays an important role in the selection of the leading EOF of midlatitude variability. Further analysis also shows a propagating feedback, common to both EOF1 and EOF2, which is responsible for the poleward drift of wind anomalies with time. The observations support the following feedback mechanism. Anomalous baroclinic wave activity is generated at the latitude of anomalous temperature gradient that, by thermal wind, coincides with the latitude of the anomalous zonal jet. The net propagation of baroclinic wave activity away from the jet gives momentum fluxes into the jet. This positive feedback is partially offset by low-frequency, equivalent barotropic eddies that propagate into the jet and remove momentum from it. The bias toward equatorward wave propagation on a sphere contributes to the poleward drift of the wind anomalies.},

Defining persistent anomalies as those of at least 100 m in magnitude lasting for at least 5 days, it is found that the region of most frequent occurrence is over the South Pacific. A cluster analysis of monthly PPA counts shows two distinct patterns, one a zonal wavenumber-1 (ZW1) pattern centered over the southeast Pacific near 60°S and the other a zonal wavenumber-3 (ZW3) pattern with centers near New Zealand and over the southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Results were insensitive to the choice of dataset, and to the removal of a linear trend from the daily height fields. The southeast Pacific PPA region is strongly modulated by ENSO, while the ZW3 pattern appears only weakly related to ENSO variability. A strong upward trend is apparent in occurrence of the ZW3 cluster, related to a matching trend in the variance of the height fields, particularly those from ECMWF. Such trends are at least in part a consequence of changes in the observing system, particularly the introduction of satellite soundings in the late 1970s.},

	abstract = {Earth's weather and climate are strongly influenced by synoptic scale systems such as extratropical cyclones. From this point of view, investigating the mechanisms associated with cyclogenesis, such as baroclinic instability (BI), which are defined by the thermal gradient and wind shear, are extremely important. However, atmospheric teleconnection patterns such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon may affect BI in the preferred region of extratropical cyclones, known as the storm track (ST) region. Therefore, the present study shows the impact of ENSO on BI and STs in the Southern Hemisphere. BI is determined by means of the Eady growth rate method, while the STs are calculated from the kinetic energy and by means of the meridional heat transport. In general, the results show that STs calculated from the BI and the kinetic energy show seasonal variability during ENSO events. This results in Southern Hemisphere extratropical cyclones being more intense with trajectories towards lower (higher) latitudes during El Niño (La Niña) summers. In contrast, little difference is seen in El Niño and La Niña winters. For the calculation of the meridional heat transport at 500 hPa, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis produced weaker transport relative to ERA-Interim and previous studies.},

	abstract = {This study presents an assessment of the ability of the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2—Earth system configuration (HadGEM2-ES)—in simulating the mid-latitude storm tracks over the Southern Hemisphere (SH). The storm tracks are primarily assessed using cyclone tracking using data from a 4 member ensemble of 27-year simulations of HadGEM2-ES over the historical period, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis. Both winter and summer periods are considered and contrasted. Results show that the storm track (ST) climatology of HadGEM2-ES presents similar patterns to those of the reanalysis. However, the model tends to represent the austral winter ST position with an equatorward bias and a zonal bias in the spiral towards the pole. The main differences were found during the austral winter, with large track density biases over the Indian Ocean indicating a poor representation of the ST in this specific region. This was found to be related to two factors. First, the large negative genesis biases over South America, Antarctic Peninsula and the Antarctic coast. Second, the model resolution and the representation of the Andes Mountains in South America. The link between STs and the large-scale circulation is examined and shows at upper levels an equatorward jet position bias of the subtropical jet and a negative bias in the eddy-driven, associated with a large cold bias over the extratropical and polar regions. The analysis of the large-scale circulation shows that the split jet during winter has problems in the model linked to these biases, including geopotential anomaly and sea surface temperature biases. Consequently, in general the track densities over the Southern oceans are underestimated in the austral winter. During summer, the results show the STs move poleward and there is a single eddy-driven jet, which is represented relatively well compared with the winter situation. These factors tend to reduce the differences seen in the cyclone track distribution biases. Although the model has biases in the ST behaviour in the SH it is still considered that these do not preclude this model being used for perturbation and future projection studies.},

	abstract = {Poleward migration of eddy-driven jets is found to occur in the extratropics when the subtropical and eddy-driven jets are clearly separated, as achieved by simulations at high-rotation rates. The poleward migration of these eddy-driven baroclinic jets over time is consistent with variation of eddy momentum flux convergence and baroclinicity across the width of the jet. We demonstrate this using a high-resolution idealized GCM where we systematically examine the eddy-driven jets over a wide range of rotation rates (up to 16 times the rotation rate of Earth). At the flanks of the jets, the poleward migration is caused by a poleward bias in baroclinicity across the width of the jet, estimated through measures such as Eady growth rate and supercriticality. The poleward biased baroclinicity is due to the meridional variation of the Coriolis parameter, which causes a poleward bias of the eddy momentum flux convergence. At the core of the jets, the poleward biased eddy momentum flux convergence relative to the mean jet deflects over time the baroclinicity and the jets poleward. As the rotation rate is increased, and more (narrower) jets emerge the migration rate becomes smaller due to less eddy momentum flux convergence over the narrower baroclinic zones. We find a linear relation between the migration rate of the jets and the net eddy momentum flux convergence across the jets. This poleward migration might be related to the slow poleward propagation of temporal anomalies of zonal winds observed in the upper troposphere.},

A two-way equilibration is found between the relative responses of the mean baroclinicity and baroclinic eddy intensity, whereby mean baroclinicity responds more strongly to eddy friction whereas eddy intensity responds more strongly to the thermal forcing of baroclinicity. These seemingly counterintuitive responses are reconciled using the steady state of a predator-prey relationship between baroclinicity and eddy intensity. This relationship provides additional support for the well-studied mechanism of baroclinic adjustment in Earth’s atmosphere, as well as providing a new mechanism whereby eddy dissipation controls the large-scale thermal structure of a baroclinically unstable atmosphere. It is argued that these two mechanisms of baroclinic adjustment and dissipative control should be used in tandem when considering storm-track equilibration.},

	abstract = {Earth’s midlatitudes are dominated by regions of large atmospheric weather variability—often referred to as storm tracks— which influence the distribution of temperature, precipitation and wind in the extratropics. Comprehensive climate models forced by increased greenhouse gas emissions suggest that under global warming the storm tracks shift poleward. While the poleward shift is a robust response across most models, there is currently no consensus on what the underlying dynamical mechanism is. Here we present a new perspective on the poleward shift, which is based on a Lagrangian view of the storm tracks. We show that in addition to a poleward shift in the genesis latitude of the storms, associated with the shift in baroclinicity, the latitudinal displacement of cyclonic storms increases under global warming. This is  achieved by  applying a storm-tracking algorithm to an ensemble of CMIP5 models. The increased latitudinal propagation in a warmer climate is shown to be a result of stronger upper-level winds and increased atmospheric water vapour. These changes in the propagation characteristics of the storms can have a significant impact on midlatitude climate.},

By the end of this century, winter mid-latitude storms are projected to intensify in the Southern Hemisphere, with large consequences over the entire extra-tropics. Therefore, it is critical to be able to accurately assess the impacts of anthropogenic emissions on these storms to improve societal preparedness for future changes. Here we show that current climate models severely underestimate the intensification in mid-latitude storm tracks in recent decades. Specifically, the intensification obtained from reanalyses has already reached the model-projected end-of-the-century intensification. The biased intensification is found to be linked to biases in the zonal flow. These results question the ability of climate models to accurately predict the future impacts of anthropogenic emissions in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes.},

The near-surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity are compared with datasets of in situ observations, together with an assessment of the simulated surface mass balance (approximated by precipitation minus evaporation). No reanalysis clearly stands out as the best performing for all areas, seasons, and variables, and each of the reanalyses displays different biases. CFSR strongly overestimates the relative humidity during all seasons whereas ERA-5 and MERRA-2 (and, to a lesser extent, ERA-Interim) strongly underestimate relative humidity during winter. ERA-5 captures the seasonal cycle of near-surface temperature best and shows the smallest bias relative to the observations. The other reanalyses show a general temperature underestimation during the winter months in the Antarctic interior and overestimation in the coastal areas. All reanalyses underestimate the mean near-surface winds in the interior (except MERRA-2) and along the coast during the entire year. The winds at the Antarctic Peninsula are overestimated by all reanalyses except MERRA-2. All models are able to capture snowfall patterns related to atmospheric rivers, with varying accuracy. Accumulation is best represented by ERA-5, although it underestimates observed surface mass balance and there is some variability in the accumulation over the different elevation classes, for all reanalyses.},

It allows detailed studies of atmospheric flow features such as blocks or cyclones. We investigate characteristics of blocks and cyclones in ERA5 using different algorithms, compare the results to ERA5's predecessor, ERA-interim, and investigate how these characteristics depend on spatial resolution. Generally, ERA5 and ERA-interim characterize blocks and cyclones similarly. For Lagrangian detection and tracking methods, blocks are more robust than cyclones to changes in resolution and reanalysis choice. Eulerian methods are robust to changes in resolution. Thus, ERA5 provides a state-of-the-art reanalysis for the synoptic-scale extratropical circulation. We find that Lagrangian cyclone characteristics are strongly dependent on spatial resolution and therefore recommend that model and reanalysis data should be mapped to a common resolution for verification.},

	abstract = {During 1979–2014, eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures significantly cooled, which has generally been attributed to the transition of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation to its negative phase after 1999. We find the eastern tropical Pacific cooling to be associated with: (1) an intensified Walker Circulation during austral summer (December–February, DJF) and autumn (March–May, MAM); (2) a weakened South Pacific Hadley cell and subtropical jet during MAM; and (3) a strengthening of the circumpolar westerlies between 50 and 60°S during DJF and MAM. Observed cooling in the eastern tropical Pacific is linearly congruent with 60–80 \% of the observed Southern Hemisphere positive zonal-mean zonal wind trend between 50 and 60°S during DJF ({\textasciitilde}35 \% of the interannual variability), and around half of the observed positive zonal-mean zonal wind trend during MAM ({\textasciitilde}15 \% of the interannual variability). Although previous studies have linked the strengthened DJF and MAM circumpolar westerlies to stratospheric ozone depletion and increasing greenhouse gases, we note that the continuation of the positive SAM trends into the twenty-first century is partially associated with eastern tropical Pacific cooling, especially during MAM when zonal wind anomalies associated with eastern tropical Pacific cooling project strongly onto the observed trends. Outside of DJF and MAM, eastern tropical Pacific cooling is associated with opposing zonal wind anomalies over the Pacific and Indian sectors, which we infer is the reason for the absence of significant positive SAM trends outside of DJF and MAM despite significant eastern tropical Pacific cooling seen during all seasons.},

	abstract = {Abstract Do barotropic or baroclinic eddy feedbacks dominate the atmospheric circulation response to mechanical forcing? To address this question, barotropic torques are imposed over a range of latitudes in both an idealized general circulation model (GCM) and a barotropic model. The GCM includes both baroclinic and barotropic feedbacks. The barotropic model is run in two configurations: 1) only barotropic feedbacks are present and 2) a baroclinic-like feedback is added by allowing the stirring region to move with the jet. The relationship between the latitude of the forcing and the response is examined by systematically shifting the torques between the tropics and the pole. The importance of the mean state is investigated by varying the position of the control jet. Five main findings are presented: 1) Barotropic feedbacks alone are capable of producing the structure of the GCM response to mechanical forcing but are not capable of accounting for its full magnitude. 2) Baroclinic processes generally increase the magnitude of the response but do not strongly influence its structure. 3) For a given forcing, the largest response in all model configurations occurs 5°–10° poleward of the forcing latitude. 4) The maximum response occurs when the forcing is located approximately 10° poleward of the control jet. 5) The circulation response weakens as the mean jet is found at higher latitudes in all model configurations.},

	abstract = {Abstract The leading patterns of large-scale climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere are examined in the context of extratropical kinetic energy. It is argued that variability in the Southern Hemisphere extratropical flow can be viewed in the context of two distinct and largely independent structures, both of which exhibit a high degree of annularity: 1) a barotropic structure that dominates the variance in the zonal-mean kinetic energy and 2) a baroclinic structure that dominates the variance in the eddy kinetic energy. The former structure corresponds to the southern annular mode (SAM) and has been extensively examined in the literature. The latter structure emerges as the leading principal component time series of eddy kinetic energy and has received seemingly little attention in previous work. The two structures play very different roles in cycling energy through the extratropical troposphere. The SAM is associated primarily with variability in the meridional propagation of wave activity, has a surprisingly weak signature in the eddy fluxes of heat, and can be modeled as Gaussian red noise with an e-folding time scale of approximately 10 days. The baroclinic annular structure is associated primarily with variations in the amplitude of vertically propagating waves, has a very weak signature in the wave fluxes of momentum, and exhibits marked quasi periodicity on time scales of approximately 25–30 days. Implications for large-scale climate variability are discussed.},

The eddy effect is assessed through the direct eddy thermal forcing via eddy heat flux and the indirect forcing via eddy-driven mean meridional circulation (MMC). We find that in addition to the synoptic eddy-induced MMC suggested by Robinson (2006), the direct eddy thermal forcing by low-frequency eddies is significant in driving the baroclinic anomalies. These two processes together prevail over the direct baroclinicity deduction by synoptic eddies. The different effects of synoptic and low-frequency eddies might be attributed to the distinct latitudinal distributions of their low-level eddy heat flux relative to the midlatitude jet. The different roles of the MMC induced by synoptic eddy momentum and heat flux are also emphasized, with the former leading the baroclinic anomalies and the latter acting to extend the baroclinic anomalies.},

The reliability and stability of the composites has been tested using multiple permutation methods and by comparison with the results obtained using a longer period (1950–79) of SH rawinsonde station data. In the SH winter, a weak equivalent–barotropic wavetrain pattern of anomalies extends over Australia and the South Pacific Ocean to South America. This wavetrain pattern is quite variable in amplitude and location between ENSO events, although it is more stable over the subtropical Pacific. In the SH summer, the circulation anomalies are more zonally symmetric, with increased height at low and high latitudes and decreased height in middle latitudes. The circulation anomalies in the SH summer are more stable than in winter, with similar patterns of anomalies in the subtropics and middle latitudes in all events.},

It is shown that patterns from unfiltered meridional wind series in the SH display all the features needed to represent the synoptic-scale waves. Typical periods and wavelengths are similar to those observed in the Northern Hemisphere (4 days, 4000 km), although over the Pacific Ocean they can be as high as 7–8 days and 4700 km, respectively. As in the Northern Hemisphere, tilts are not geographically fixed but change with the stage of the evolution of the wave. The phase speed of the waves agrees with the low-level winds in extensive areas of the middle latitudes and ranges from 12 m s −1 in the Indian Ocean to 6 m s−1 in the Pacific Ocean. The estimated group velocities achieve maximum values of about 38 m s −1, also in the Indian Ocean, and agree with the upper-level maximum winds, in accord with reported model results for the leading fringe of the wave packets. The wave packets show a decay of upstream centers as new ones grow downstream, suggesting that down-stream development contributes to the evolution of the synoptic-scale waves in the SH storm track. This process is observed both in the subpolar and subtropical jets, but the sequence of centers developing downstream is more coherent in the latter, probably due to the weaker baroclinicity.},

An experiment with zonally symmetric tropical SSTs expands the SH upper-tropospheric storm track poleward and eastward and destroys its spiral structure. Diagnosis suggests that these aspects of the observed storm track result from Rossby wave propagation from a wave source in the Indian Ocean region associated with the monsoon there. The lower-tropospheric storm track is not sensitive to this forcing. However, an experiment with zonally symmetric midlatitude SSTs exhibits a marked reduction in the magnitude of the maximum intensity of the lower-tropospheric storm track associated with reduced SST gradients in the western Indian Ocean. Experiments without the elevation of the South African Plateau or the Andes show reductions in the intensity of the major storm track downstream of them due to reduced cyclogenesis associated with the topography. These results suggest that the zonal asymmetry of the SH winter storm track is mainly established by stationary waves excited by zonal asymmetry in tropical SST in the upper troposphere and by local SST gradients in the lower troposphere, and that it is modified through cyclogenesis associated with the topography of South Africa and South America.},

The influence of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in the cyclones track density during the austral spring was also evaluated. Mean sea level pressure from National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis was used in an automatic scheme for cyclones tracking. The influence of the teleconnection patterns in the cyclones location is assessed through two methodologies: composite analysis and partial correlation technique. For whole SH and considering the total of cyclones and the stronger ones (with central pressure lower than 980 hPa in some period of their lifecycle) there is a statistically significant positive trend, while for weak cyclones the negative trend is not statistically significant. These patterns of trend occur along the year except in the spring. Regionally, the trend signal (positive or negative) of the cyclones occurrence varies spatially in each austral ocean. We suggested that the positive trend of the cyclones in high latitudes of the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans would be associated with the last decades global warming. The number of cyclones in the different phases of the ENSO, SAM and IOD is similar to that of neutral periods. However, these teleconnection patterns are important to modify the preferential regions of cyclones occurrence. The composite analysis of the cyclones track density during ENSO and SAM events is similar to that obtained in the partial correlation; but it is not true for IOD. Isolating ENSO and SAM effects in the cyclones track density, it is observed that the IOD positive phase contributes to the decrease in the cyclones density in large part of SH, particularly over the Indian and western South Pacific Oceans.},

When differences in vertical structure between the subpolar and subtropical jet streams (SPJ and STJ, respectively) are considered, the regional characteristics can be interpreted reasonably well from a potential vorticity perspective of baroclinic eddy growth and downstream development of a baroclinic wave packet. Eddy activity in the upper and lower tropospheres is strongest in the core region of the SPJ over the eastern South Atlantic and Indian Ocean throughout the year, even in austral winter when the intense STJ forms over the Indian Ocean and South Pacific. Showing its eddy-driven nature, the SPJ accompanies the strong surface westerlies along a well-defined baroclinic zone above an intense oceanic frontal zone. In this core region of the storm track, low-level eddy activity is strongly correlated with the local near-surface baroclinicity, with its late- winter maximum and summer minimum, while upper-level eddy activity also depends on the incoming wave activity from upstream. Over the South Pacific, storm track activity depends critically on the formation of the STJ. In the absence of the intense STJ in summer and autumn, a single well-defined circumpolar storm track forms along the SPJ. During winter and spring, in contrast, wave activity accumulated in the core region is dispersed mainly toward the STJ, along which vigorous baroclinic eddy growth is unlikely to occur. The South Pacific storm track in the upper troposphere thus bifurcates into two branches along the STJ and SPJ, while at lower levels the storm track forms only along the enhanced baroclinic zone along the SPJ. Thus, under the trapping effect of the intense STJ, the storm track activity over the South Pacific is suppressed in winter, despite the enhanced low-level baroclinicity.},

	abstract = {Abstract Impacts of the ENSO and Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) phenomena on winter storm-track activity over the Southern Hemisphere are examined on the basis of the observed and reanalysis data for 1979–2003. The partial correlation technique is utilized to distinguish the impact of one phenomenon from that of the other. During an El Niño event, the subtropical jet stream tends to strengthen substantially, enhancing the jet bifurcation and thereby reducing storm-track activity over the midlatitude South Pacific and to the south of Australia. During a positive IOD event, the westerlies and storm-track activity also tend to weaken over southern Australia and portions of New Zealand. Thus both the positive IOD and, to a lesser extent, El Niño events act to reduce winter rainfall significantly over some portions of South Australia and New Zealand. Precipitation over the southeastern portion of the continent and over the northern portions of the two main islands of New Zealand is more sensitive to IOD. Significant reduction in precipitation associated with an El Niño event is seen over Tasmania. Over midlatitude South America, in contrast, the enhancement of the westerlies and storm-track activity tends to be more significant in a positive IOD event than in an El Niño event. It is demonstrated that despite the dominant influence of the Southern Hemispheric Annular Mode from a hemispheric viewpoint, the remote influence of ENSO and/or IOD on local storm-track activity can be detected in winter as a significant signal in particular midlatitude regions, including South Australia and New Zealand.},

In order to aid the design of the experiments and interpretation of the results, a simplified analysis is made of the basic flow in terms of zonal wind, meridional vorticity gradient, and stationary wavenumber. From the analysis the possible existence of a strong waveguide in the Asian jet and weaker waveguides in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere jets is deduced. The possibility of propagation into the equatorial east Pacific and Atlantic oceans and even across these regions is also suggested. These features are confirmed by barotropic model integrations for a variety of perturbation vorticity source positions and shapes. These integrations also show preferred propagation regions arching across North America, from Europe to the Arabian Gulf and, in the Southern Hemisphere, into the equatorial Indian Ocean and Indonesian regions. They also show a tendency to produce a low-wavenumber, fast westward-moving “tail” along the Asian jet. Many of the features found in this study are remarkably consistent with observational teleconnection studies.},

This framework enables the mechanisms determining the tropospheric response to North Atlantic SST patterns to be examined, both in isolation and in combination with continental-scale landmasses and orography. In isolation, a “Gulf Stream” SST pattern acts to strengthen the downstream storm track while a “North Atlantic Drift” SST pattern weakens it. These changes are consistent with changes in the extratropical SST gradient and near-surface baroclinicity, and each storm-track response is associated with a consistent change in the tropospheric jet structure. Locally enhanced near-surface horizontal wind convergence is found over the warm side of strengthened SST gradients associated with ascending air and increased precipitation, consistent with previous studies. When the combined SST pattern is introduced into the semirealistic framework (including the “North American” continent and the “Rocky Mountains”), the results suggest that the topographically generated southwest–northeast tilt in the North Atlantic storm track is enhanced. In particular, the Gulf Stream shifts the storm track south in the western Atlantic whereas the strong high-latitude SST gradient in the northeastern Atlantic enhances the storm track there.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) has been observed as a deep oscillation in the mid- and high southern latitudes. In the present study, the AAO pattern is defined as the leading mode of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF-1) obtained from daily 700-hPa geopotential height anomalies from 1979 to 2000. Here the objective is to identify daily positive and negative AAO phases and relationships with intraseasonal activity in the Tropics and phases of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the austral summer [December–January–February (DJF)]. Positive and negative AAO phases are defined when the daily EOF-1 time coefficient is above (or below) one standard deviation of the DJF mean. Composites of low-frequency sea surface temperature variation, 200-hPa zonal wind, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) indicate that negative (positive) phases of the AAO are dominant when patterns of SST, convection, and circulation anomalies resemble El Niño (La Niña) phases of ENSO. Enhanced intraseasonal activity from the Tropics to the extratropics of the Southern (Northern) Hemisphere is associated with negative (positive) phases of the AAO. In addition, there is indication that the onset of negative phases of the AAO is related to the propagation of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). Suppression of intraseasonal convective activity over Indonesia is observed in positive AAO phases. It is hypothesized that deep convection in the central tropical Pacific, which is related to either El Niño or eastward-propagating MJO, or a combination of both phenomena, modulates the Southern Hemisphere circulation and favors negative AAO phases during DJF. The alternation of AAO phases seems to be linked to the latitudinal migration of the subtropical upper-level jet and variations in the intensity of the polar jet. This, in turn, affects extratropical cyclone properties, such as origin, minimum/maximum central pressure, and their equatorward propagation.},

The existence and possible self-maintenance of storm-tracks is investigated using a linear, stationary wave model with storm-track region forcings taken from data averaged over a number of winters. It is found that the direct thermal effect of the eddies does indeed act against the existence of the storm-track. Their vorticity fluxes lead to some reduction of this effect. It is argued that the mean diabatic heating in the storm-track region is an indirect eddy effect. This heating is found to maintain the mean maximum in baroclinicity in the region. Further, the mean low-level flow induced by the eddy effects is such as to enhance the warm western oceanic boundary currents that are crucial to the existence of the storm-tracks. The extent to which the Northern Hemisphere storm-tracks can be considered self-maintaining is discussed.},

	abstract = {We develop a climatology of the Amundsen Sea low (ASL) covering the period 1979–2008 using ECMWF operational and reanalysis fields. The depth of the ASL is strongly influenced by the phase of the Southern annular mode (SAM) with positive (negative) mean sea level pressure anomalies when the SAM is negative (positive). The zonal location of the ASL is linked to the phase of the mid-tropospheric planetary waves and the low moves west from close to 110°W in January to near 150°W in June as planetary waves 1 to 3 amplify and their phases shift westwards. The ASL is deeper by a small, but significant amount, during the La Niña phase of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) compared to El Niño. The difference in depth of the low between the two states of ENSO is greatest in winter. There is no statistically significant difference in the zonal location of the ASL between the different phases of ENSO. Over 1979–2008 the low has deepened in January by 1.7 hPa dec−1 as the SAM has become more positive. It has also deepened in spring and autumn as the semi-annual oscillation has increase in amplitude over the last 30 years. An increase in central pressure and eastward shift in March has occurred as a result of a cooling of tropical Pacific SSTs that altered the strength of the polar front jet.

The net sensible heat flux is positive, ocean heat loss is greater, and sea ice growth and expansion is greater in regions of colder air. The reverse is true in regions of warmer air.

	abstract = {Abstract There is increasing evidence indicating that the climate response to variations in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) includes not only thermally forced zonal wind anomalies in the subtropics but also eddy-driven zonal wind anomalies that extend into the mid–high latitudes of both hemispheres. In this study, new insights into the observed seasonally varying signature of ENSO in the extratropical zonal-mean circulation are provided and the associated linkages with the dominant patterns of extratropical variability are examined. The zonal-mean extratropical atmospheric response to ENSO is characterized by two principal features: an equivalent barotropic dipole in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) zonal-mean zonal flow with centers of action located near ∼40° and ∼60° during austral summer, and a weaker, but analogous, dipole in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) with centers of action located near ∼25° and ∼45° during early and late boreal winter. Both structures are accompanied by eddy momentum flux anomalies that exhibit a remarkable degree of hemispheric symmetry. In the SH, the extratropical signature of ENSO projects strongly onto the primary mode of large-scale variability, the southern annular mode (SAM). During the austral summer, roughly 25\% of the temporal variability in the SAM is linearly related to fluctuations in the ENSO cycle. An analogous relationship is not observed in association with the principal mode of climate variability in the NH, the northern annular mode (NAM). It is argued that the seasonally varying impact of ENSO on the extratropical circulation is consistent with the impact of the thermally forced subtropical wind anomalies on the dissipation of equatorward-propagating wave activity at subtropical latitudes.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a conceptual framework for comparing methods that isolate important coupled modes of variability between time series of two fields. Four specific methods are compared: principal component analysis with the fields combined (CPCA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and a variant of CCA proposed by Barnett and Preisendorfer (BP), principal component analysis of one single field followed by correlation of its component amplitudes with the second field (SFPCA), and singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix between the two fields (SVD). SVD and CPCA are easier to implement than BP, and do not involve user-chosen parameters. All methods are applied to a simple but geophysically relevant model system and their ability to detect a coupled signal is compared as parameters such as the number of points in each field, the number of samples in the time domain, and the signal-to-noise ratio are varied. In datasets involving geophysical fields, the number of sampling times may not be much larger than the number of observing locations or grid points for each field. In a model system with these characteristics, CPCA usually extracted the coupled pattern somewhat more accurately than SVD, BP, and SFPCA, since the patterns it yielded exhibit smaller sampling variability; SVD and BP gave quite similar results; and CCA was uncompetitive due to a high sampling variability unless the coupled signal was highly localized. The coupled modes derived from CPCA and SFPCA exhibit an undesirable mean bias toward the leading EOFs of the individual fields; in fact, for small signal-to-noise ratios these methods may identify a coupled signal that is similar to a dominant EOF of one of the fields but is completely orthogonal to the true coupled signal within that field. For longer time series, or in situations where the coupled signal does not resemble the EOFs of the individual fields, these biases can make SVD and BP substantially superior to CPCA.},

The analysis extends earlier work using a 16-yr record and confirms that the occurrence of blocking over the southeast Pacific is strongly modulated by the ENSO cycle during austral spring and summer. Comparison of results at 500 hPa with the 300-hPa meridional wind component showed that blocking events are associated with large-scale wave trains lying across the South Pacific from the region of Australia to southern South America. Similar wave trains are evident in both hemispheres in singular value decomposition analyses between 300-hPa meridional wind components and tropical Pacific outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies. The hypothesis that the divergence associated with tropical OLR anomalies forces an extratropical wave response that results in enhanced blocking over the southeast Pacific was tested using a linearized, barotropic vorticity equation (BVE) model. Observed 300-hPa mean flow fields and divergence forcing that matched the anomalous OLR were used to drive the BVE model. The resulting pattern of meridional wind and streamfunction anomalies agrees closely with observations. When the tropical OLR anomaly is given an eastward phase speed of 5° per day, the extratropical response agrees even better with observations. This suggests that linear Rossby wave propagation provides an important link between anomalous convection in the Tropics and the occurrence of blocking over the southeast Pacific Ocean.},

Higher order modes are indicative of diversion or truncation of cyclone tracks in particular geographical regions. It is demonstrated that the leading storm track modes are linked to some of the best-known monthly averaged teleconnection patterns. The dipolar western Pacific and western Atlantic patterns for the monthly mean flow are seen to be accompanied by marked changes in the intensity of the storm tracks over the western oceans, whereas the more wave-like Pacific/North American and eastern Atlantic teleconnection patterns are coincident with north–south displacements of the storm track axes over the eastern oceans. The representative synoptic scenarios for various storm track modes are portrayed using composite charts. These patterns illustrate the strong modulation of the trajectory of weather systems by the intensity and steering action of the monthly averaged flow field, so that the storm tracks are preferentially located at and slightly downstream of the quasi-stationary troughs. The shape and propagation of the synoptic scale eddies along the changing storm tracks, as well as the barotropic interactions between these disturbances and the monthly mew flow, are diagnosed using composite patterns of extended Eliassen-Palm vectors and eddy-induced geopotential tendencies at 300 mb. It is seen that the synoptic-scale fluctuations are typically crescent-shaped, and sometimes undergo noticeable deformation when they encounter quasi-stationary ridges. In the upper troposphere, enhanced eddy activity is accompanied locally by eastward acceleration, as well as by positive geopotential tendency immediately to the south, and negative geopotential tendency to the north, and vice versa. The distributions of eddy-induced geopotential tendency for individual storm track modes indicate a near inphase relationship between the synoptic scale barotropic forcing and the quasi-stationary flow pattern at 300 mb. The characteristic time scale for this forcing is approximately 7–10 days. The characteristic circulations at sea level associated with various storm track modes are examined using composite charts of the sea level pressure field. Some of these composites resemble the patterns associated the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oscillations.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper reviews the current state of observational, theoretical, and modeling knowledge of the midlatitude storm tracks of the Northern Hemisphere cool season. Observed storm track structures and variations form the first part of the review. The climatological storm track structure is described, and the seasonal, interannual, and interdecadal storm track variations are discussed. In particular, the observation that the Pacific storm track exhibits a marked minimum during midwinter when the background baroclinicity is strongest, and a new finding that storm tracks exhibit notable variations in their intensity on decadal timescales, are highlighted as challenges that any comprehensive storm track theory or model has to be able to address. Physical processes important to storm track dynamics make up the second part of the review. The roles played by baroclinic processes, linear instability, downstream development, barotropic modulation, and diabatic heating are discussed. Understanding of these processes forms the core of our current theoretical knowledge of storm track dynamics, and provides a context within which both observational and modeling results can be interpreted. The eddy energy budget is presented to show that all of these processes are important in the maintenance of the storm tracks. The final part of the review deals with the ability to model storm tracks. The success as well as remaining problems in idealized storm track modeling, which is based on a linearized dynamical system, are discussed. Perhaps on a more pragmatic side, it is pointed out that while the current generation of atmospheric general circulation models faithfully reproduce the climatological storm track structure, and to a certain extent, the seasonal and ENSO-related interannual variations of storm tracks, in-depth comparisons between observed and modeled storm track variations are still lacking.},
