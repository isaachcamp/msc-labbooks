# Literature Review

The Southern Hemisphere storm track is a region of maximum storm activity that covers the Southern Ocean in a latitude band between 40° and 60°S. It is closely associated with extremes of wind speed, cloud formation and precipitation, and has a key role in the global circulation of momentum, energy, and moisture. The storm track is an emergent property of atmospheric circulation; differential heating of the Earth creates a meridional temperature gradient, and the deflection of resulting thermal winds by the Coriolis force drive the subpolar jet stream. Storm track strength and location is strongly linked to the jet stream, acting as the potential energy store that feeds storms. Instabilities inherent in the jet, which grow with steeper temperature gradients, propagate toward the surface, creating ideal conditions for cyclogenesis -- storms form downstream of maximum baroclinic instabilities in the mean westerly flow {cite}`trenberth_storm_1991`{cite}`berbery_characteristics_1996`. The overall goal of the storm track is to reduce the meridional temperature gradient through its work in moving heat & momentum poleward, but self-maintains through eddy-driven diabatic heating and convective processes reinforcing instabilities {cite}`hoskins_existence_1990`.

Storm track behaviour is modulated by the seasonal cycle, Antarctic landmass distribution and sea ice extent -- responsible for the three characteristic variance maxima in the ocean basins -- and large-scale circulation patterns, particularly the SAM {cite}`lorenz_eddyzonal_2001`{cite}`eichler_comparison_2013`{cite}`carvalho_opposite_2005`, ENSO {cite}`trenberth_progress_1998`{cite}`inatsu_zonal_2004`{cite}`hoskins_new_2005`, and transient zonal wave activity {cite}`irving_novel_2015`{cite}`raphael_influence_2007`{cite}`goyal_new_2022`, which have been shown to have significant impacts on how the storm track and individual storms manifest. It is important to understand how and why storm tracks vary with these external drivers as projections of storm track behaviour will be a key component in implementing effective policies on risk mitigation. The response of the SH storm track to the shifting climate remains unclear due to opposing influences {cite}`shaw_storm_2016`, however, a basic analysis suggests rising global temperature will enhance the SH meridional temperature gradient, leading to stronger storms. The uncertainty is exacerbated by the paucity of literature on the SH storm tracks, particularly on its relationship with ZW3. It is therefore valuable to document what the latest reanalyses say.

Significant uncertainties around projected storm track behaviour are associated with SAM and ENSO in particular. SAM appears as a modal phenomenon with a positive and negative phase (hereafter SAM+ and SAM--), which manifest as changes in average circulation over the Antarctic region and midlatitudes. Signatures of SAM+ include reduced average pressures over Antarctica and increased average pressures over the midlatitudes, whilst the reverse is true of SAM-- {cite}`renwick_southern_2006`. These circulation anomalies affect storm track position, storm frequency and intensity -- a stronger pressure gradient introduces greater instabilities in the polar jet and force storm track meridional migration. The relationship of baroclinic storms to the climatological westerly flow has been documented for the zonal mean circulation in Lorenz and Hartmann, 2001 {cite}`lorenz_eddyzonal_2001`. They identified an eddy-driven positive feedback mechanism that causes persistence of a given SAM mode. This is due in part to a net positive number of storms moving equatorward out of the mid-latitude jet region -- a bias resulting from Earth's spherical geometry -- creating a poleward momentum transfer bias, since baroclinic waves transfer momentum opposite to their direction of travel. This drives a poleward propagation of the jet and reinforces baroclinic instabilities in the mean flow. The net equatorward movement of storms also accounts for the effect of the SAM on the subtropics. The recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole -- the primary driver of the SAM positive trend {cite}`thompson_signatures_2011` -- whose future is dependent on the concentration of atmospheric CFCs, introduces another uncertainty in projected storm track behaviour, whilst continuing greenhouse gas emissions are expected to push the positive trend {cite}`fogt_southern_2020`.

ENSO is an interannual cycle that directly affects the shape and position of the storm track via its teleconnections. Inatsu & Hoskins (2004) find tropical sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) have a strong influence on the upper tropospheric jet, whilst mid-latitude SSTAs are a major driver in the formation and propagation of storms in the lower troposphere {cite}`inatsu_zonal_2004`{cite}`hoskins_new_2005`{cite}`brayshaw_basic_2011`. SSTAs arising during warm El NNiñoino events cause strong convection in the tropics, creating the necessary conditions for propagation of Rossby wave trains from the sub-tropics, notably over the western Pacific. These wave trains move poleward, and are the major source of observed teleconnection patterns such as the Pacific South American (PSA), a large-scale wave pattern particularly apparent during austral winter {cite}`karoly_southern_1989`{cite}`carvalho_opposite_2005`. The storm track in turn amplifies and even controls the propagation of wave trains, creating a positive feedback loop {cite}`trenberth_progress_1998`{cite}`reboita_trend_2015`. The mechanism for this is described in greater detail in Karoly (1989) and Goyal et al. (2021).

ZW3 is a quasi-stationary wave that plays a pivotal role in poleward heat and momentum transport, especially during the winter months, which has recently been linked to Rossby wave trains caused by tropical convection events {cite}`goyal_zonal_2021`. Rossby wave trains are deflected equatorward by wave guides in the high latitudes and eventually decay in the tropics -- which Goyal et al. (2021) suggest creates a ZW3-like signal on average. ZW3 centres of high and low pressure interact with storms and can exacerbate extreme weather events. Changes to SH circulation that generate tropical convection events such as ENSO are expected to affect ZW3, as well as warming SSTs, which will weaken teleconnections through increased tropospheric static stability, weakening vertical motions and convective circulation. As westerlies strengthen with warming temperatures, stationary wave theory suggests that the wavenumber – inversely proportional to zonal mean flow – generated by tropical convection events will decrease.

The effects of low-frequency variability on the mean height field is well-documented {cite}`lheureux_observed_2006`{cite}`trenberth_progress_1998`; however, how those changes affect high-frequency variability has yet to be comprehensively explored. We aim to make clear links between the two fields, specifically how the mean height field interacts with the storm track and the exact nature of that relationship, through the exploration of leading modes of co-variability and linkages from the above outlined large-scale circulation phenomena. This study will look to corroborate established relationships from previous reanalyses datasets {cite}`trenberth_storm_1991`{cite}`eichler_comparison_2013`{cite}`sinclair_objective_1994`, and to glean new insights. 

We will document storm track characteristics with the latest ERA-5 reanalysis dataset, and identify teleconnections or interactions between the storm track, SAM, ENSO, and ZW3. We take an Eulerian approach, using the 500hPa geopotential height mean height field anomalies and high-frequency variance anomalies field, the latter field analogous to amount of storm activity; details of our methodology can be found in section 2. Section 3 looks at a Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) of the mean height field and high-frequency variance field, to establish whether large-scale circulation patterns emerge as leading variability modes. Section 4 inspects patterns of covariance generated from monthly time series of the two fields and standard indices of SAM, ENSO and ZW3. Finally, in support of this analysis, section 5 studies composites of the strongest events in each atmospheric phenomena (_these were not isolated to a single data point per extrema, therefore may have composited consecutive months for particularly strong and persistent events, this means that variability between events may have been obscured_).


## To incorporate

- Coriolis Force
    - The coriolis force arises as a consequence of a non-inertial reference frame, and serves to deflect the motion of air parcels to be deflected to the left of their direction of motion. It is the coriolis force that drives the subpolar jet stream. 
    - Baroclinic instabilities naturally occur as a consequence of the meridional temperature gradient -- when the flow reaches a critical velocity, instabilities become inherent. This transition can be observed by starting a simplified GCM from an isotropic initial condition and allowing it to evolve under differential heating, i.e., greater insolation at the equator versus the poles, creating a meridional temperature gradient {cite}`wallace_7_2006`. An upper-tropospheric equatorward tilt in the axis of baroclinic waves creates a net equatorward movement of heat in the upper levels, whereas in the low troposphere, baroclinic waves possess a bias toward moving heat in the opposite direction -- the climatological mean of this mechanism creates a Ferrel cell. This arises due to the nature of a baroclinic wave and geostrophic circulation of air about centres of low pressure. West of the baroclinic wave's low cold, dry air is moved equatorward, whereas east -- ahead of the low -- warm, moist air is moved poleward. The tilt in the axis of the wave creates a stronger gradient east of the trough, whilst a weaker gradient is found west, creating a net poleward heat and moisture flux {cite}`peixoto_physics_1992`.
- Why do storms form out of baroclinic instabilities?
    - Storms are baroclinic waves, which begin as small disturbances in the mean flow that intensify, feeding off potential energy stores in the form of thermal gradients. The Norwegian Cyclone model states that the wave begins to form along frontal zones, regions where cold and warm fronts encounter, as a low centre close to the Earth's surface, downstream of maximum baroclinic instabilities in the jet. Baroclinic instabilities in the jet cause upper-level divergence. Basic conservation laws dictate there must be lower-level convergence to account for the resulting upper-level mass loss, causing convection and cloud formation. The cold front moves equatorward around the low, whilst the warm front moves poleward creating a circulatory motion. Eventually the trough becomes occluded from the frontal zone, isolated from the thermal gradient from which it takes its energy, and so decays.
- How do baroclinic instabilities propagate downward to create storms?
    - Through the divergence at the tropopause causing lower-level convergence.
- Areas of cyclolysis and cyclogenesis -- form downstream of maximum instabilities (jet streak), also decay upstream of mountain ranges and grow downstream. Form in the background mean flow due to maximum baroclinic instability in the form of jet streaks (particularly strong regions of the jet stream), propagating toward the surface where the maximum low occurs. They can also form as a result of residual baroclinic wave packets that have longer lifetimes than a baroclinic storm. They are more commonly found at the level of the jet. {cite}`mcmurdie_8_2006`
- What are the jet entry and exit regions?
    - Regions of particularly strong jet stream, called a jet streak. An instance would be the Indian Ocean maximum in the SH. The entry region is an area upstream of the maximum, and the exit region is the equivalent area downstream. 
- Lagrangian v Eulerian methods.
    - Lagragian methods are better adapted to identifying the relationship between the climatological mean (storm track) and the behaviour of individual storms, such as preferential areas of cyclogenesis and cyclolysis, areas of high baroclinic wave incidence and the typical path a storm takes. Lagrangian methods may be better suited to establishing the relationship between storms and ZW3.

- A number of previous studies attempt to draw connections between the Z500 field and storm track variability, however, the NH remains the main focus {cite}`lau_variability_1988`, with little literature performing similar analyses on the SH. Wettstein & Wallace (2009) briefly look into SH teleconnective patterns, including SAM, and storm track variability, however, they do not draw conclusions about whether SAM influences the storm track over the whole hemisphere or only parts. This study will show that SAM is a leading mode of variability governing the interactions between Z500 and storm track variability over the entire hemisphere.
- Lau (1988) uses an EOF analysis and calculates correlations between PC time series and those of indices relating to prominent NH teleconnective patterns. A similar method was applied to attempt to draw conclusions about which MCA pattern on daily timescales corresponds to ENSO teleconnections.
