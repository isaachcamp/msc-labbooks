# To Do List

## Things to Do

- Write paper.
    - Rewrite, Connect figures to text.
    - Include Table with all SCF and PCs Correlation values.
- Write abstract for NZ Met Conference -- deadline: 22nd August. (https://www.hydrometsoc22.co.nz/presenter-guidelines)
- Check spread of indices for models. Do they simulate frequency of extreme values?
    - Map for areas of high standard deviations/variances? -- for all models and ERA-5.
- Think about how to quantify the bias in annual cycle.
    - James' suggestion:
        - Calculate the mean height & variance of height through time for each grid point during each season.
        - Calculate Root Mean Square (RMS) value over the spatial field, i.e., sum of difference between model mean and ERA-5 mean at each grid point.
        - Add up the RMS values for each season and compare between models. The best should have the smallest RMS.
- Quantify the base state bias.
    - Show James and pick which field to use:
        - Full mean height field.
        - Mean height anomalies.
        - Full variance field.
        - Variance anomalies.
        - Detrended versions of the above.
        - Plot time series vs. detrended time series.
    - Find the zonally-averaged mean height and plot vs. latitude.
    - Repeat the same analysis for the variance field -- where is the meridional gradient peak?
- Look into Taylor Diagrams.
- Check SOI is calculated correctly, and re-calculate if necessary. Run the analysis procedure over each model for SOI alone.


## Questions to Answer

- What is the Eliasson-Palm flux and what does it represent? Trenberth 1991 seems to use E-P flux as a proxy for representing eddy fluxes of several characteristics of storms.
- The jet axis tends to be located above a narrow sloping zone of strong potential temperature gradients, called the _polar-frontal zone_, which separates the cold polar air from the warm tropical air. This is a result of the thermal wind balance. Why is this?
