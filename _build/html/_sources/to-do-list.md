# To Do List

## Things to Do

- Write paper.
- Finish lagged analysis.
- Correlation between PC2 and SOI -- is the second mode due to variability in ENSO?
- Add significant regions to covariance maps.
- Write abstract for NZ Met Conference.
- Read papers on ERA5 reanalyses.
- Mention units for covariance, what do they mean?
- Read thorugh week 10 notes and check out common features found in maps -- [week 10](era5_analysis/week10.md).
    - Positive over negative? Positive over positive? Vice versa?
    - Consistency between seasons of different phase bins?
    - Spiral-like structure as seen in JJA 0 - 60 degrees?


## Questions to Answer

- Is geostrophic balance the reason why there is momentum convergence in the storm tracks?
- What is the Eliasson-Palm flux and what does it represent? Trenberth 1991 seems to use E-P flux as a proxy for representing eddy fluxes of several characteristics of storms.
- The jet axis tends to be located above a narrow sloping zone of strong potential temperature gradients, called the _polar-frontal zone_, which separates the cold polar air from the warm tropical air. This is a result of the thermal wind balance. Why is this?
