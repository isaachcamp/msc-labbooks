### An Objective Storm Track Climatology for the Southern Hemisphere {cite}`sinclair_objective_1994`

#### Summary

Uses automatic tracking procedure using relative vorticity. Finds high incidence of systems on either side of the South Africa and South American continent and high incidence of storms occur around Antarctica, as per historical literature, however also finds a higher incidence of storms in lower latitudes than has been found before. Many of these are stationary storms, likely formed from topographic variations, that do not play much of a role in transferring momentum, and as such are discounted. By ignoring stationary systems, the mean climatology looks much more like the familiar annulus around Antarctica, around 50S. Much more storm centres during winter, as expected given the higher temperature gradient, and associated higher instabilities. Also in winter the distribution is broader in latitudinal extent, likely to do with the presence of the subtropical storm jet that only occurs in the winter months. Finds a low incidence region south of New Zealand during winter.

#### Seasonal Variations

Greatest track density around 50S, true in both summer and winter, in agreement with [Trenberth 1991](Trenberth1991). The maxima found in the Indian ocean by Trenberth is also identified, and attributed to the incidence of high intensity storms that cause greater fluctuations in the geopotential height field. Also makes the connection between higher incidence rates of storm centres over warmer waters east of a continental landmass, and fewer over cooler waters to the west. In agreement with Trenberth over the consistency of SH storm track, in that it is much more consistent throughout the year than the NH, due to the lack of landmasses.


### Objective Identification of Cyclones and Their Circulation Intensity, and Climatology {cite}`sinclair_objecive_1997`

#### Summary

An updated method is applied for tracking storm centres, common associated problems are outlined and solutions/strategies for minimisation are offered, and an updated climatology is offered for Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

#### Southern Hemisphere Climatology

Track density maximises between 50-60S in Atlantic and Indian oceans, however it maximises south of 60S in the Pacific -- _could be due to Amundsen sea low?_ Track density can be seen as analogous to maximal variance in geopotential height. A secondary maximum spans the Pacific around 40S, likely associated with the subtropical jet (STJ) which splits east of Australia in the winter. Highly symmetrical distribution compared to NH. Associates cyclogensis with SST gradients in each ocean, downstream of maximum gradients, around 40S, specifically it connects the rapid intensification of cyclones with SST gradients. 


### Influence of El Niño-Southern Oscillation on baroclinic instability and storm tracks in the Southern Hemisphere {cite}`machado_influence_2020`

#### Summary

Makes a connection between baroclinic instability (BI) and storm track, and investigates the effect of ENSO on each using quantities that capture each. Uses Eady growth rate as a measure of baroclinic instability, and the transfer of kinetic energy and poleward heat flux as a measure of the storm track behaviour. Suggests that El Nino events cause fewer storms to be 
Increase in baroclinic instability during summer La Nina events in the Atlantic and Pacific around 50-60S, however there is a reduction in BI south of 60S.

#### Details

Increased Hadley cell activity during El Nino events causes increased BI around 30-60S. However, there is a lower BI south of 60S.

- "Machado et al. (2012) and Machado et al. (2016). According to the authors, warmer conditions in the SH, would favour a reduction of the thermal gradient between the polar and the equatorial regions, with a consequent reduction of baroclinic activity."
- "Rao et al. (2003) and Carmo and Souza (2009), by analysing the link between the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) and the role of the sea surface temperature (SST) to the STs, argue that during La Niña events, there is a southward shift of STs in relation to their climatological position, mainly over the Indian and Western Pacific oceans."
