### Observed Patterns of Month-to-Month Storm-Track Variability and Their Relationship to the Background Flow {cite}`wettstein_observed_2010`

Associates monthly storm track variability with dominant patterns of 300hPa meridional wind (which they seem to use as the proxy for the storm track, appears to max out at the same latitude, in between mean height field maxima and minima), Z500 and 850hPa meridional heat flux fields. Finds correlations between NH teleconnective patterns and dominant EOF projections from one or other of the three fields invesigated. Considers two main modes of variability associated with the storm track, "pulsing" -- variation in strength of the storm track -- and latitudinal shifting. Also identifies the depth to which the patterns and modes of variability extend through the troposphere, finding that they tend to extend from sea level to the top of the troposphere. They suggest that the modes of variability are associated with changes to the climatological-mean upper tropospheric jet stream.

They use sector-segmented EOFs and PCs that isolate variability in that sector alone, and find that much more variance is explained (not necessariliy surprising, but the difference is significant, e.g., 77% up from 9% in the leading EOF of the SH). Applying this method could find similar results for our results, particularly when trying to correlate the SOI with a PC in MCA, as the field response seems to be largely local -- Wettstein and Wallace term this 'hemispheric incoherence'. This is more relevant for the NH however, and this study doesn't make conclusions about whether the SAM modulates storm track variability on a hemispheric scale, whereas our analysis certainly seems to indicate that.

### Variability of the Observed Midlatitude Storm Tracks in Relation to Low-Frequency Changes in the Circulation Pattern {cite}`lau_variability_1988`

Correlation between PCs of Z500 and Northen Hemisphere teleconnection patterns. This paper takes correlations between the PCs of the EOF analysis and indices for the teleconnective patterns, as we did with the SOI, can reference this paper as a legitimatisation of our method.

### Storm Track Dynamics {cite}`chang_storm_2002`

Describes NH storm track structure and variability, also the understood physical processes up to 2002. 

Description of a localised, large-scale storm track forming as a climatological mean state as a result of interacting physical, small-scale mechanisms: developing on from the formulation of storm tracks as a local/normal mode of the zonally varying mean flow around the mid-latitudes, it is now argued that the storm track is a result of complex interactions between present residual baroclinic wave packets and baroclinic and barotropic growth processes, modulated by zonal variation. This combines with a number of other important processes, most notably that of diabatic heating and convection, which play a modifying role in the strength and location of transient eddies.

Section 3 -- Questions that can theoretically be answered by the current understanding as it was in 2002:
- "What fuels transient eddy development within storm tracks?"
- "Are storm tracks self-sustaining in the sense that they can develop eddies in the absence of seeding by recirculation of disturbances (coherent baroclinic wave packets) around the globe?"
- "Do transient eddy life cycles change as a function of longitude within storm tracks?" 
- "What terminates storm tracks?"
- "To what extent is latent heating important to overall storm track structures?"


To investigate:

External forcing that causes a change to the storm track, whether in intensity or meridional migration, can lead to a positive feedback, whereby the changes to heat and momentum flux as a result of the altered storm track can in turn force greater anomalies in general atmospheric circulation.

"the annual cycle of storm track activity in the Pacific exhibits a marked minimum during the midwinter, first noted by Nakamura (1992)" -- this is presumably in the NH, may not be relevant in the SH. However, it did appear that this was the case over the Pacific, whilst the baroclinicity should be at its height in winter, the storm track was seemimigly weaker. _This is something to check out in the figures._ And why might this be the case? "Chang (2001a) provides evidence that a number of factors, including changes in eddy structure, eddy residence times over the baroclinic region, and differences in diabatic heating contributions to eddy energy generation, influence the ability of eddies to tap into the baroclinicity of the large-scale flow." The diabatic heating contributions aspect in more detail: there is reduced convectional heating during the winter months, as opposed to the other seasons, which may be another reason why there is a suppression of high-frequency variance. -- Chang (2001a) shows that spring and fall have higher convectional heating.

"storm tracks exhibit marked variations in their intensity on decadal timescales (Chang and Fu 2002)"

"It is well known from life cycles of nonlinear baroclinic waves on zonally homogeneous flows (see the review by Pierrehumbert and Swanson 1995) that downgradient heat fluxes occur during the growth stage of such waves in the lower troposphere, and are followed by large meridional fluxes of zonal momentum in the upper troposphere."

Connecting the storm to the storm track, although the Norwegian model is useful for clarifying aspects of individual storms, the life cycle is largely unrepresentative of the majority of transient eddies found within the storm track. Instead, the storm track is composed of an ensemble of baroclinic waves in various stages of growth and decay, with certain features of the life cycle preferentially chosen according to the zonally varying mean flow. For instance, the preferred regions of cyclogenesis and cyclolysis, downstream and upstream of the South American Andes. The regions of high heat and momentum fluxes can be seen as part of the climatological circulation at all levels of the atmosphere as maxima and minima in the high-frequency variance of geopotential height. -- _check out Chang and Orlanski 1993 for a citation_. The localised, large-scale storm track forms as a climatological mean state as a result of interacting small-scale mechanisms: developing on from the formulation of storm tracks as a normal mode of the zonally varying mean flow around the mid-latitudes, it is now understood that the storm track is a result of complex interactions between present residual baroclinic wave packets and baroclinic and barotropic growth processes, modulated by zonal variation. This combines with a number of other important processes, most notably that of diabatic heating and convection, which play a modifying role in the strength and location of transient eddies. {cite}`chang_storm_2002`

Could be relevant for ZW3 waveguides, are they guided by the storm track? - how do they become the asymmetrical component of SAM?
"The phase propagation is primarily zonal, and the preferred zones of propagation with the largest time-lagged phase coherence, or ‘‘baroclinic waveguides,’’ more or less coincide with the storm tracks themselves (Wallace et al. 1988)"

Good for finding citations when referring to baroclinic eddies as wave packets:
"More significantly, storm track transients also behave as wave packets, characterized by a welldeveloped group velocity property (Lee and Held 1993; Chang 1993)"

Justification of Eulerian method:
"This wave propagation characteristic suggests that the high bandpass variability not only marks regions of high cyclone frequency, but also is oriented along the paths of phase and group propagation of synoptic transients. As such, the description ‘‘storm tracks’’ is truly apt."

Use the following references when linking ENSO to the storm track: (Trenberth and Hurrell 1994; Straus and Shukla 1997; Zhang and Held 1999). They relate how the storm track shifts equatorward and downstream of the climatological mean during El Nino events, whilst the opposite is true during La Nina events. These are linked to the response of the local Hadley circulation (Bjerknes 1966, 1969), enhanced under El Nino conditions, whilst reduced under La Nina.

Does this relate to how ZW3 affects the storm track? Or how it guides individual storms?: "Because the storm track eddies are in turn organized by the stationary wave (Branstator 1995)"
