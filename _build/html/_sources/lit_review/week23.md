### Demystifying Climate Models {cite}`gettelman_demystifying_2016`

#### Key Concepts in Climate Modelling

ESMs aim to characterise the probability distribution of weather states (the climate) by running time integrations -- or model runs -- over a long period with realistic mechanics and constraints. The model runs should be independent, zero correlation, and predict different states at each time step, however, the probability distribution will ideally be the same for every model run.

##### Uncertainty

Models can be wrong, and the likelihood of them being wrong is qunatified as uncertainty. Uncertainty in models can be categorised into three sources.

- Model Uncertainty:
    - Structural errors, errors in the way the model is set up, e.g., physical mechanics such as cloud formation.
- Scenario Uncertainty:
    - Errors in the assumptions of how parameters change/evolve, such as the amount of CO2 emitted. This type of uncertainty dominates the long-term uncertainty.
- Initial Conditions Uncertainty
    - Errors stemming from the inability to be exact in the qunatifying the initial conditions, which propagate into the future if the model is sensitive to initial conditions. This may not have strong long-term effects on the long-term distribution, however, short-term forecasts can be severely affected.

#### Components of the Climate System

ESMs are usually composed of different building blocks, different systems that have specific boundaries where they can interact and specified mechanisms for those interactions. Typically these blocks are:

    - Atmosphere
        - Chemical make-up of air and all physical processes that occur within, including chemical interactions. Radiative budget and transfer of energy, momentum and mass are key components, so too are the carbon and hydrologic cycles.
    - Ocean
        - Chemical make-up of the oceans, physical properties such as carbon stores and acidity levels, large-scale ocean currents (circulation patterns), thermohaline circulation (stratification).
    - Terrestrial
        - Land use and resulting albedo, chemical interactions between this sphere and ocean & atmosphere.
    - Cryosphere
        - Sea ice, glaciers, ice sheets, snow.
    - Anthroposphere
        - Impacts of human activity.
    - Biosphere
        - Living organisms, soil, plants and animals.

Interactions between these systems occur on different timescales, and key elements of the Earth System, such as Carbon and Water, can cycle through different components. Understanding the interactions, movement and timescales of such cycles are of vital importance to creating a good ESM.
