# Literature Review

The Southern Hemisphere storm track is a region of maximum storm activity that covers the Southern Ocean in a latitude band between 40° and 60°S. It is closely associated with extremes of wind speed, cloud formation and precipitation, and has a key role in the global circulation of momentum, energy, and moisture. The storm track is an emergent property of atmospheric circulation; differential heating of the Earth creates a meridional temperature gradient, and the deflection of resulting thermal winds by the Coriolis force drive the subpolar jet stream. Storm track strength and location is strongly linked to the jet stream, acting as the potential energy store that feeds storms. Instabilities inherent in the jet, which grow with steeper temperature gradients, propagate toward the surface, creating ideal conditions for cyclogenesis -- storms form downstream of maximum baroclinic instabilities in the mean westerly flow {cite}`trenberth_storm_1991`{cite}`berbery_characteristics_1996`. The overall goal of the storm track is to reduce the meridional temperature gradient through its work in moving heat & momentum poleward, but self-maintains through eddy-driven diabatic heating and convective processes reinforcing instabilities {cite}`hoskins_existence_1990`. 

Baroclinic instabilities emerge as a natural consequence of a meridional temperature gradient -- when the flow reaches a critical velocity, instabilities in a viscous flow are inherent. This transition can be observed by starting a simplified GCM from an isotropic initial condition and allowing it to evolve under differential heating, i.e., greater insolation at the equator versus the poles, creating a meridional temperature gradient {cite}`wallace_7_2006`. An upper-tropospheric equatorward tilt in the axis of baroclinic waves creates a net equatorward movement of heat in the upper levels, whereas in the low troposphere, baroclinic waves possess a bias toward moving heat in the opposite direction -- the climatological mean of this mechanism creates a Ferrel cell -- _is this correct?_. This arises due to the nature of a baroclinic wave and geostrophic circulation of air about centres of low pressure, or troughs. West of the storm trough, cold, dry air is moved equatorward, whereas east -- ahead of the trough -- warm, moist air is moved poleward. The tilt in the axis of the wave creates a stronger gradient east of the trough, whilst a weaker gradient is found west, creating a net poleward heat and moisture flux {cite}`peixoto_physics_1992`. The net flux reduces the meridional temperature gradient, thereby removing the source of its energy and leading to the decay of baroclinic instabilities in the storm track. However, Hoskins & Valdes (1990) find heat & momentum fluxes peak downstream of maximum instabilities, thereby reducing the draining effect, whilst also arguing the storm track self-maintains through eddy-driven diabatic heating and convective processes, reinforcing instabilities {cite}`hoskins_existence_1990`. "Latent heat release due to condensation in rising air over the warm sector of cyclones in general acts as an additional energy source to fuel the development of those eddies, and numerous theoretical (e.g., Mak 1982; Emmanual et al. 1987; Fantini 1995), numerical, and diagnostic (e.g., Gutowski et al. 1992; Davis et al. 1993; Reed et al. 1992; etc.) studies have shown that the growth rate and amplitude of baroclinic waves are enhanced by condensational heating." -- _Chang et al. 2002_

Storms are baroclinic waves, which begin as small disturbances in the mean flow that intensify, feeding off potential energy stores in the form of thermal gradients. The Norwegian Cyclone model provides a general description of the life cycle of a baroclinic storm. The baroclinic wave begins to form along frontal zones, regions where cold and warm fronts encounter, as a low centre close to the Earth's surface, downstream of maximum baroclinic instabilities in the jet. Storms are also associated with water vapour flux and cloud formation: upper-level divergence in the jet causes lower-level convergence to account for the upper-level mass loss, causing convection and cloud formation. The cold front moves equatorward around the low, whilst the warm front moves poleward creating a circulatory motion. Eventually the trough becomes occluded from the frontal zone, isolated from the thermal gradient from which it takes its energy, and so decays.

Connecting the storm to the storm track, although the Norwegian model is useful for clarifying aspects of individual storms, the life cycle is largely unrepresentative of the majority of transient eddies found within the storm track. Instead, the storm track is composed of an ensemble of baroclinic waves in various stages of growth and decay, with certain features of the life cycle preferentially chosen according to the zonally varying mean flow. For instance, the preferred regions of cyclogenesis and cyclolysis, downstream and upstream of the South American Andes. The regions of high heat and momentum fluxes can be seen as part of the climatological circulation at all levels of the atmosphere as maxima and minima in the high-frequency variance of geopotential height. -- _check out Chang and Orlanski 1993 for a citation_. The localised, large-scale storm track forms as a climatological mean state as a result of interacting small-scale mechanisms: developing on from the formulation of storm tracks as a normal mode of the zonally varying mean flow around the mid-latitudes, it is now understood that the storm track is a result of complex interactions between present residual baroclinic wave packets and baroclinic and barotropic growth processes, modulated by zonal variation. This combines with a number of other important processes, most notably that of diabatic heating and convection, which play a modifying role in the strength and location of transient eddies. {cite}`chang_storm_2002`

There exists areas of preferential cyclolysis (storm formation) and cyclogenesis (storm decay). Storm formation predominantly occurs downstream of maximum instabilities in the jet stream, whether in the mean flow or downstream of orographic features such as mountain ranges. Storms frequently decay in regions upstream of these same orographic features, for example the regions identified in s Form in the background mean flow due to maximum baroclinic instability in the form of jet streaks (particularly strong regions of the jet stream), propagating toward the surface where the maximum low occurs. Cyclogenesis also occurs due to residual baroclinic wave packets, which possess longer lifetimes than a baroclinic storms, more commonly found at the level of the jet {cite}`mcmurdie_8_2006`. "Coherent nonlinear baroclinic wave packets were first noted in the Southern Hemisphere and in simple models by Lee and Held (1993)." -- _Chang et al 2002_. In a process known as downstream development, these baroclinic wave packets decay by transferring energy to their downstream neighbours, thereby maintaining their group coherence as they circumnavigate the globe. In many cases, downstream development of transient eddies is driven by the decay of their upstream counterparts.
Regions of particularly strong jet stream are known as jet streaks. One instance would be the region of maximum variance in the SH Indian Ocean. Entry and exit regions are area up- and downstream of the maximum, respectively. 

Atmospheric circulation patterns of variability result from external drivers, as well as emerging from internal dynamics of the Earth system. Storm track behaviour is modulated by the seasonal cycle, Antarctic landmass distribution and sea ice extent -- responsible for the three characteristic variance maxima in the ocean basins -- and large-scale circulation patterns, particularly the SAM {cite}`lorenz_eddyzonal_2001`{cite}`eichler_comparison_2013`{cite}`carvalho_opposite_2005`, the ENSO {cite}`trenberth_progress_1998`{cite}`inatsu_zonal_2004`{cite}`hoskins_new_2005`, and transient zonal wave activity {cite}`irving_novel_2015`{cite}`raphael_influence_2007`{cite}`goyal_new_2022`, which have been shown to have significant impacts on how the storm track and individual storms manifest. It is important to understand how and why storm tracks vary with these external drivers as projections of storm track behaviour will be a key component in implementing effective policies on risk mitigation. The response of the SH storm track to the shifting climate remains unclear due to opposing influences {cite}`shaw_storm_2016`, however, a basic analysis suggests rising global temperature will enhance the SH meridional temperature gradient, leading to stronger storms. The uncertainty is exacerbated by the paucity of literature on the SH storm tracks, particularly on its relationship with ZW3. It is therefore valuable to document what the latest reanalyses say. 

- A number of previous studies attempt to draw connections between the Z500 field and storm track variability, however, the NH remains the main focus {cite}`lau_variability_1988`_find more citations_, with little literature performing similar analyses on the SH. Wettstein & Wallace (2010) {cite}`wettstein_observed_2010` briefly look into SH teleconnective patterns, including SAM, and storm track variability, however, they do not reach a conclusion about whether SAM influences the storm track over the whole hemisphere or only parts. This study will show that SAM is a leading mode of variability governing the interactions between Z500 and storm track variability over the entire hemisphere.
- Lau (1988) uses an EOF analysis and calculates correlations between PC time series and those of indices relating to prominent NH teleconnective patterns. A similar method was applied in our analysis to associate leading patterns in MCA on daily timescales with the ENSO teleconnection. 

Significant uncertainties around projected storm track behaviour are associated with SAM and ENSO in particular. SAM appears as a modal phenomenon with a positive and negative phase (hereafter SAM+ and SAM--), which manifest as changes in average circulation over the Antarctic region and midlatitudes. Signatures of SAM+ include reduced average pressures over Antarctica and increased average pressures over the midlatitudes, whilst the reverse is true of SAM-- {cite}`renwick_southern_2006`. These circulation anomalies affect storm track position, storm frequency and intensity -- a stronger pressure gradient introduces greater instabilities in the polar jet and force storm track meridional migration. The relationship of baroclinic storms to the climatological westerly flow has been documented for the zonal mean circulation in Lorenz and Hartmann, 2001 {cite}`lorenz_eddyzonal_2001`. They identified an eddy-driven positive feedback mechanism that causes persistence of a given SAM mode. This is due in part to a net positive number of storms moving equatorward out of the mid-latitude jet region -- a bias resulting from Earth's spherical geometry -- creating a poleward momentum transfer bias, since baroclinic waves transfer momentum opposite to their direction of travel. This drives a poleward propagation of the jet and reinforces baroclinic instabilities in the mean flow. The net equatorward movement of storms also accounts for the effect of the SAM on the subtropics. The recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole -- the primary driver of the SAM positive trend {cite}`thompson_signatures_2011` -- whose future is dependent on the concentration of atmospheric CFCs, introduces another uncertainty in projected storm track behaviour, whilst continuing greenhouse gas emissions are expected to push the positive trend {cite}`fogt_southern_2020`.

ENSO is an interannual cycle that directly affects the shape and position of the storm track via its teleconnections. Inatsu & Hoskins (2004) find tropical sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) have a strong influence on the upper tropospheric jet, whilst mid-latitude SSTAs are a major driver in the formation and propagation of storms in the lower troposphere {cite}`inatsu_zonal_2004`{cite}`hoskins_new_2005`{cite}`brayshaw_basic_2011`. SSTAs arising during warm El NNiñoino events cause strong convection in the tropics, creating the necessary conditions for propagation of Rossby wave trains from the sub-tropics, notably over the western Pacific. These wave trains move poleward, and are the major source of observed teleconnection patterns such as the Pacific South American (PSA), a large-scale wave pattern particularly apparent during austral winter {cite}`karoly_southern_1989`{cite}`carvalho_opposite_2005`. The storm track in turn amplifies and even controls the propagation of wave trains, creating a positive feedback loop {cite}`trenberth_progress_1998`{cite}`reboita_trend_2015`. The mechanism for this is described in greater detail in Karoly (1989) and Goyal et al. (2021).

ZW3 is a quasi-stationary wave that plays a pivotal role in poleward heat and momentum transport, particularly during the winter months. ZW3 has recently been linked to Rossby wave trains caused by tropical convection events {cite}`goyal_zonal_2021`. A number of previous studies link Rossby wave propagation from anomalous deep convection events in the tropics {cite}`karoly_southern_1989`{cite}`trenberth_progress_1998`{cite}`inatsu_zonal_2004`. Trenberth et al. (1998) and Karoly (1989) argue ENSO events create a Rossby wave train that is apparent in the climatological mean state, whilst Inatsu & Hoskins (2004) argue propose wave trains generated by convection events in the Indian Ocean are a leading cause of asymmetry in SAM. Goyal et al. (2021) picks up this line of reason, and suggests that Rossby wave trains, predominantly forced by deep convection over the West Pacific Warm Pool and ENSO-forced events, create a ZW3-like signal on average.The mechanism proposed is as such: SSTAs increase humidity creating atmospheric instability, making the atmosphere susceptible to deep convection, causing the moist air parcel to rise. This motion sets up a local Hadley cell, with tropical upper-level divergence and sub-tropical upper-level convergence. The convergence in the sub-tropics acts as a Rossby wave source, exciting a poleward and eastward Rossby wave train that is deflected equatorward by wave guides at high latitudes and decays in the tropics. The eventual decay is due to Rossby wave propagation requiring a westerly mean flow, a condition which is absent in the tropics. ZW3 phase is dependent on the location of the source in the subtropics.

ZW3 centres of high and low pressure interact with storms and can exacerbate extreme weather events, they have also been suggested that ZW3 guides or changes the course of storms {cite}`find_citation`. Changes to SH circulation that generate tropical convection events such as ENSO are expected to affect ZW3, as well as warming SSTs, which will weaken teleconnections through increased tropospheric static stability, weakening vertical motions and convective circulation. As westerlies strengthen with warming temperatures, stationary wave theory suggests that the wavenumber – inversely proportional to zonal mean flow – generated by tropical convection events will decrease.

The effects of low-frequency variability on the mean height field is well-documented {cite}`lheureux_observed_2006`{cite}`trenberth_progress_1998`; however, how those changes affect high-frequency variability has yet to be comprehensively explored. We aim to make clear links between the two fields, specifically how the mean height field interacts with the storm track and the exact nature of that relationship, through the exploration of leading modes of co-variability and linkages from the above outlined large-scale circulation phenomena. This study will look to corroborate established relationships from previous reanalyses datasets {cite}`trenberth_storm_1991`{cite}`eichler_comparison_2013`{cite}`sinclair_objective_1994`, and to glean new insights. 

We will document storm track characteristics with the latest ERA-5 reanalysis dataset, and identify teleconnections or interactions between the storm track, SAM, ENSO, and ZW3. We take an Eulerian approach, using the 500hPa geopotential height mean height field anomalies and high-frequency variance anomalies field, the latter field analogous to amount of storm activity; details of our methodology can be found in section 2. Section 3 looks at a Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) of the mean height field and high-frequency variance field, to establish whether large-scale circulation patterns emerge as leading variability modes. Section 4 inspects patterns of covariance generated from monthly time series of the two fields and standard indices of SAM, ENSO and ZW3. Finally, in support of this analysis, section 5 studies composites of the strongest events in each atmospheric phenomena (_these were not isolated to a single data point per extrema, therefore may have composited consecutive months for particularly strong and persistent events, this means that variability between events may have been obscured_).


## To incorporate

- Lagrangian v Eulerian methods.
    - Lagragian methods are better adapted to identifying the relationship between the climatological mean (storm track) and the behaviour of individual storms, such as preferential areas of cyclogenesis and cyclolysis, areas of high baroclinic wave incidence and the typical path a storm takes. Lagrangian methods may be better suited to establishing the relationship between storms and ZW3.

Changes to the winter storm track in the NH: "Recently, Geng and Sugi (2001) and Graham and Diaz (2001) have shown that the frequency and intensity of extreme cyclones over both the Atlantic and Pacific basins have increased over the second half of the twentieth century." -- Chang et al. 2002 -- Are there equivalent studies in the SH indicating the same? Or maybe there are contradictory studies?
