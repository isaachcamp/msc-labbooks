# To Do List

- Chapter 1
    - Redo figures:
        - Mask low variance and remove colour scales.
        - Redo ZW3 annual composite without lower composites.
        - Add phase bins to ZW3 annual covariance and composite figure.
        - Add season labels and remove autolabel feature from pygmt generated figures.
        - Get intervals and masking limits for all ERA-5 figures.
    - Make corrections.
        - Redo composites with seasonal sample size of 10.
    - Read up on MCA method again, make sure you understand the implications of it.

- Chapter 2
    - Back-up/Compare Results with References e.g. Zhang et al. 2022, Bracegirdle et al. 2020 and Lee et al. 2019
    - Include extra components from discussion.
    - MCA
        - More emphasis on the connections between the two fields.
    - Covariance Maps
        - Include spatial correlations and RMSEs.
        - Look into and mention seasonal differences, e.g. compare with Lee et al. 2019, is the post-dominant season still the weakest?
        - Create portrait plot and refer to it.
        - Ensure that the RMSEs for ZW3 are being calculated correctly -- are the small spatial correlation values due to the intentional change of sign? -- or is it because they are not directly related back to the observations, i.e., the extrema are not located in the same place?
    - CBF analysis
        - Download meridional wind anomalies, va.
        - Calculate CBFs for each model from the following EOF analyses on ERA-5:
            - SAM -- zg500 EOF1
            - A-SAM -- zg500 zonal anomalies EOF1
            - ENSO/PSA 1 & 2 -- zg500 EOF2 & 3
            - ZW3 -- va EOF1 & 2
        - Create portrait plot for these and for seasonality of mean fields and refer to it in text.
