# To Do List

## Things to Do

- Write paper.
    - Rerun sub-monthly with 15-day rolling means.
    - Sensitivity test/Rule N test.
- Bias in annual cycle.
    - Another method that retains some of the spatial structure?
- Look into Taylor Diagrams.
- Check what the resolution required for Eulerian method in Rohrer et al. (2020) {cite}`rohrer_sensitivity_2020`.
- Check singular vectors 1 & 2 of all model ZW3 indices.
    - Are there some that do not have ZW3 signals?
- Base state analysis:
    - Check out whether models are spectral something or other (perhaps it's called a Gibbs effect?)
    - Check out what the second graph of diffs is actually calculating.
- Collate a list of tools for model intercomparison: check Eyring et al., section 3.3 (2016) {cite}`eyring_overview_2016`.
- Read up on model analysis:
    - AR6 Chapter 1: Section 1.5.4
    - AR5 Chapter 9
    - AR3 Chapter 12
    - Gettelman & Rood Chapters 9, 10 & 13
- Lit Review SH ST:
    - Read up on ST as normal modes: Fredricksen & Fredricksen.
    - Read up on baroclinic wave packet theory.
    - Find papers detailing interactions between ST and ZW3.
    - Find a reference linking baroclinicity with strong temperature gradients.
- Write up Methodology for CMIP6 chapter.
    - Include diagrams of indices box plots, and discussion. 


## Questions to Answer

- What is the Eliasson-Palm flux and what does it represent? Trenberth 1991 seems to use E-P flux as a proxy for representing eddy fluxes of several characteristics of storms.
- The jet axis tends to be located above a narrow sloping zone of strong potential temperature gradients, called the _polar-frontal zone_, which separates the cold polar air from the warm tropical air. This is a result of the thermal wind balance. Why is this?
