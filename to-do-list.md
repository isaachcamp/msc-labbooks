# To Do List

- Base state analysis:
    - Check out whether models are spectral something or other (perhaps it's called a Gibbs effect?)
- Collate a list of tools for model intercomparison: check Eyring et al., section 3.3 (2016) {cite}`eyring_overview_2016`.
- Redo figures:
    - Ch.1 figures masking low variance colour scale.
        - Add phase bins to ZW3 covariance figure.
- Write up results.
    - Composites
        - ENSO
        - ZW3
- Find model-associated papers.
- Make corrections for Chp.1.
    - Redo composites with seasonal sample size of 10.
- Get intervals and masking limits for all ERA-5 figures.
    - Add intervals and mask figures to all CMIP6 figures.
- Write-up Selecting Subsample section.
- Complete Abstract to include model components.
