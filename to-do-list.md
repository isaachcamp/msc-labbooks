# To Do List

## Things to Do

- Check what the resolution required for Eulerian method in Rohrer et al. (2020) {cite}`rohrer_sensitivity_2020`.
    - They downscale resolution from the original for ERA5 and ERA-Interim datasets (may be dataset dependent), hence not neccessarily losing sub-grid information. They find little difference between the original resolution and 1 and 2 degree resolutions. They find that bandpassed Z500 variance is insensitive to dataset and resolution, therefore we should ba able to expand that result to our model outputs with not too much difficulty.
- Check singular vectors 1 & 2 of all model ZW3 indices.
    - There were none that were clearly not ZW3 signals, however, Goyal et al. (2021) find that GFDL-CM4 EOF2 and FGOALS-f3-L EOF1 & 2 have ZW4 signals...
- Base state analysis:
    - Check out whether models are spectral something or other (perhaps it's called a Gibbs effect?)
- Collate a list of tools for model intercomparison: check Eyring et al., section 3.3 (2016) {cite}`eyring_overview_2016`.
- Write up Methodology for CMIP6 chapter.
  - Include diagrams of indices box plots, and discussion. 
- Redo whole analysis for 1979-2014 period.
- Add MME mean to Taylor Diagrams.
