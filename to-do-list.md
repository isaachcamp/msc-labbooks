# To Do List

## Things to Do

- Write paper.
    - Create publication-quality figures.
        - Add significant regions to covariance maps.
    - Read Papers.
        - Trenberth et al. 1998
        - Carvalho et al. 2005
        - Bretherton et al. 1992 - SVD analysis/MCA method
- Write abstract for NZ Met Conference.


## Questions to Answer

- What is the Eliasson-Palm flux and what does it represent? Trenberth 1991 seems to use E-P flux as a proxy for representing eddy fluxes of several characteristics of storms.
- The jet axis tends to be located above a narrow sloping zone of strong potential temperature gradients, called the _polar-frontal zone_, which separates the cold polar air from the warm tropical air. This is a result of the thermal wind balance. Why is this?
