# To Do List

## Things to Do

- Write paper.
- Check spread of indices for models. Do they simulate frequency of extreme values?
    - Map for areas of high standard deviations/variances? -- for all models and ERA-5.
- Bias in annual cycle.
    - Another method that retains some of the spatial structure?
    - Apply RMSD script to all models.
- Quantify the base state bias.
    - Show James and pick which field to use:
        - Full mean height field.
        - Mean height anomalies.
        - Full variance field.
        - Variance anomalies.
        - Detrended versions of the above.
        - Plot time series vs. detrended time series.
    - Find the zonally-averaged mean height and plot vs. latitude.
    - Repeat the same analysis for the variance field -- where is the meridional gradient peak?
- Look into Taylor Diagrams.
- Check SOI is calculated correctly, and re-calculate if necessary. Run the analysis procedure over each model for SOI alone.
- Check what the resolution required for Eulerian method in Rohrer et al. (2020) {cite}`rohrer_sensitivity_2020`.
- Check singular vectors 1 & 2 of all model ZW3 indices.
    - Are there some that do not have ZW3 signals?


## Questions to Answer

- What is the Eliasson-Palm flux and what does it represent? Trenberth 1991 seems to use E-P flux as a proxy for representing eddy fluxes of several characteristics of storms.
- The jet axis tends to be located above a narrow sloping zone of strong potential temperature gradients, called the _polar-frontal zone_, which separates the cold polar air from the warm tropical air. This is a result of the thermal wind balance. Why is this?
