# Projected Chanegs in the SH Storm Track

## A robust increase in the eddy length scale in the simulation of future climates, Kidston et al. 2010 {cite}`kidston_robust_2010`

The authors identify an increase in eddy length scale in projected climate from CMIP3 model output, on the order of 5% by the end of the 21st century. The eddy length scale influences height and latitudinal location at which eddies tend to dissipate. _What is the eddy length scale though?_ Accoring to Vallis (2006), the location of generation and dissipation of eddies has a profound affect on the large-scale mean circulation. The authors also make a connection between this change and the projected increase in dry static stability of the atmosphere.

They also suggest that there has been an increase in recent decades according to the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses.


## Changing State of the Climate System, AR6 Chapter 2 {cite}`gulev_changing_2021`

Finds polar jets (and associated storm tracks) have _likely_ been shifting poleward since the 1980s{cite}`pena-ortiz_observed_2013`, with seasonal variability (though this seems more related to the NH {cite}`manney_seasonal_2018`), and number of strong extratropical cylcones has _likely_ increased {cite}`reboita_trend_2015`{cite}`wang_inter-comparison_2016`. However, confidence of both projections remains low. 

The poleward movement of the SH polar jet is consistent with the expansion of the tropics and the positive trend in the SAM {cite}`kang_impact_2011`{cite}`gulev_changing_2021`. This trend appears to cease during DJF after 2000 {cite}`banerjee_pause_2020`, Banerjee et al. (2020) suggest this is a result of international law (Montreal Protocol) implemented to reduce ozone depletion, which subsequently halted the positive SAM trend also.

Chang (2017) uses an MME of 26 models and finds the frequecny of extreme storms is also due to increase.
