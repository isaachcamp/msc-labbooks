# Diagnosing Base State Biases

## Mean State

## Seasonal Cycle

Calculate the mean height & variance of height through time for each grid point during each season.
Calculate Root Mean Square (RMS) value over the spatial field, i.e., sum of difference between model mean and ERA-5 mean at each grid point.
Add up the RMS values for each season and compare between models. The best should have the smallest RMS.
