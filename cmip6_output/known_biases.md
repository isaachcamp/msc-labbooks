# Known Biases in SH Storm Track

## Intermodel variability of the poleward shift of the austral jet stream in the CMIP3 integrations linked to biases in 20th century climatology, Kidston & Gerber (2010) {cite}`kidston_intermodel_2010`

Kidston & Gerber (2010) find biases in the SH jet stream mean state explain intermodel differences in the projected trend. Specifically, they suggest an equatorward bias in average jet stream position is associated with projections of enhanced persistance of the SAM and of exaggerated poleward migration. Knowledge of the magnitude of this poleward shift is important as the storm track has profound affects on mid-latitude regional precipitation and the hydrological cycle.

They suggest the reason the models have an exaggerated poleward shift in storm track position is because atmospheric radiative forcing sets a limit to how far the jet stream can move into the high latitudes, _though I'm not sure what the radiative forcing has to do with this -- is it the notion that the extra momentum being shifted poleward must dissipate into through the atmosphere?_

Useful Notes:

They use the same technique as us, by using a slightly offset period to the reanlyses dataset but maintaining the same sample size -- "The slight difference in the analysis period for the models and the reanalyses was allowed to improve statistical confidence and avoid pre-satellite era reanalyses. All of our key results are equivalent (but with less statistical confidence) if we restrict analysis to 1979–2000."


## Fourth CLIVAR Workshop on the Evaluation of ENSO Processes in Climate Models: ENSO in a Changing Climate, Guilyardi et al. 2016 {cite}`guilyardi_fourth_2016`

ENSO-relevant biases:

- "Transition zone between eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue and west Pacific warm pool occurs too far west in most models, affecting the structure of the wind response and remote teleconnections."

"One presentation showed that increasing the model resolution can reduce many of these biases, but it can also reveal previously unrecognized biases in other coupled components."

Guilyardi recommends improvements in understanding of processes are the key improving model physics.

## Human Influence on the Climate System, AR6 Chapter 3 {cite}`eyring_human_2021`

AR5 concluded models capture general characteristics of the storm track {cite}`flato_evaluation_2013`, but most models underestimate storm intensity and frequency (linked to SSTs), and resolution plays a significant role in model fidelity in representing storms. Priestley et al. (2020){cite}`priestley_overview_2020` and Zappa et al. (2013){cite}`zappa_ability_2013` (albeit for the NH), among others, found increased resolution improves simulation. 

Priestley et al. (2020) finds considerable improvement in storm track average position during summer, but remains too far equatorward in high-resolution models, too far poleward in low resolution models {cite}`priestley_overview_2020`. In winter, models underestimate storm track density in the Indian Ocean, overestimate in the Pacific .

## An Overview of the Extratropical Storm Tracks in CMIP6 Historical Simulations, Priestley et al. (2020) {cite}`priestley_overview_2020`

"In the SH winter season [June–August (JJA)] there is both a zonal and equatorward bias of the storm tracks (Kidston and Gerber 2010; Chang et al. 2012), with these errors possibly being linked to biases in cloud shortwave radiative processes (Ceppi et al. 2012), low-level orographic drag (Pithan et al. 2016), or the localized representation of blocking (Patterson et al. 2019)."
