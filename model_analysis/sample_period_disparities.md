# 1979-2014 Sample Period Differences

## Base State

Seasonality wise there is some shifting in average rank, however, the top 10 models remain the same, and the MME mean remains the second best performing. There is one change in the peak position; CESM2 height gradient peaks at 52 degrees South for 1972-2014, but at 53 degrees South for the shortened period from 1979.

## MCA

The first two modes are largely the same, but greater disparity is found in the higher order modes. Fewer modes were unique for the shorter period (even the second mode was regularly non-unique). However, although spatial patterns remain consistent, the SCF was quite variable, such that some physical signals, such as the ENSO teleconnection, were occasionally relegated to much higher modes in the 1972-2014 period. Greater disparities are found in the seasonal analyses, arising mostly in the higher order modes, but even leading modes exhibit small differences in spatial structure. This highlights the sensitivity of such analyses to sample size and the issue of identifying statistically unique modes. Subsequently, less emphasis should be placed on the mode in which physical signals appear, and only the broadest themes in the seasonal analyses can be commented upon. In future, a large sample size is desirable for a similar analysis.

## Corr/Cov Maps

Qualitatively the same, with very minimal difference between the two sample periods, both annually and seasonally. The spatial pattern as well as the maximum magnitude of correlation & covariance was approximately equal. In a large proportion of maps, there was a higher proportion of significant grid points in the 1972-2014 period, likely due to the larger sample size.

## Composites

Minimal differences were found in the annual composites for all indices, being a comprised of approximately 25 observations. In the seasonal composites, there were clear differences between the two sample periods; one composite was regularly comprised of only 5 observations, such that if any observation fell in between the yers 1972-1979, this observation would have a sizeable impact on the composite. Although the broad picture was consistent between periods, the minimum number of observations was increased to 10 to decrease the sensitivity to sample period.
