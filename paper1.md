# Working Title - Southern Hemisphere storm tracks and interactions with large-scale variability: what do the ERA5 Reanalyses say? 

## Abstract


## Introduction

Storm tracks are geographical areas with a high incidence of storms, located across a discrete latitude band between 40°and 60°S. They are closely associated with extremes of wind speed, cloud formation and precipitation, and as such, have a key role in the global circulation of momentum, energy, and moisture. Storms form from baroclinic instabilities in the mean westerly flow, instabilities which grow with steeper temperature gradients. It is well-known that baroclinic storms are a key component in transferring energy and momentum poleward, and their relationship to the climatological westerly flow has been documented {cite}`lorenz_eddyzonal_2001`. A net positive number of storms move equatorward out of the mid-latitude jet region, a bias resulting from Earth's spherical geometry, which creates a poleward momentum transfer bias since these baroclinic waves transfer momentum opposite to their direction of travel to uphold and reinforce the jet.

Storm track strength and location is associated with the polar jet {cite}`trenberth_storm_1991`{cite}`lorenz_eddyzonal_2001` _find more citations_, since the jet acts as the potential energy store that storms feed off. The baroclinic instability inherent in the powerful polar jet propagates toward the surface, creating ideal conditions for baroclinic storm formation. 

Predictions suggest the storm track will intensify and move poleward with the changing climate -- which could serious implications for global circulation patterns. 

The effect of the storm track reduces the meridional temperature gradient through its work in moving heat & momentum poleward. _read On the Existence of Storm Tracks, Hoskins & Valdez 1990_

Storm track strength and location is associated with the polar jet through the Coriolis force and thermal wind relation, which are in turn affected by sea ice extent. This momentum transfer plays an important role in reducing the temperature gradient between the equator and the poles, any change to which could see serious consequences. Reductions in sea ice will weaken the temperature gradient between the equator and the poles, leading to lower mean westerly flow velocities in accordance with the thermal wind relation. This will likely reduce the baroclinic instability from which storms form, potentially reducing storm incidence hence momentum transfer poleward -- a potential negative feedback. 

It is suggested that the reason for the higher variance in the Indian ocean is due to the Antarctic landmass extending to much lower latitudes in this sector, and in turn the sea ice has a further extent, _find citation_. This modulates the temperature gradient, by maintaining a lower temperature at lower latitudes, hence the gradient between the equator and Antarctica is greater. The thermal wind relation indicates the jet stream over this sector is stronger, hence there are greater instabilities translating into more frequent storms. The opposite is true over the Pacific sector, where the Antarctic landmass does not extend far north, hence there is generally a lower incidence of storms. This is a climatological mean state, but which relates strongly to the Antarctic sea ice extent. A reduction in the sea ice will lead to a weaker temperature gradient, hence potentially weaker polar jet and fewer storms. This could seriously upset global circulation patterns.

The response of the SH storm track to the shifting climate remains unknown as a number of influences have opposing effects (Shaw et al. 2016), however, a basic analysis suggests rising global temperature will enhance the meridional temperature gradient – the potential energy store from which storm systems draw their energy – leading to stronger storms. The uncertainty is exacerbated
by the paucity of literature on the SH storm tracks. It is therefore valuable to document what the latest reanalyses say, as well as what model output suggests.

It is important to understand how storm tracks vary with large-scale circulation patterns; SAM, ENSO, IOD and ZW3 are external drivers of storm track activity which have been shown to have significant impacts on how the storm track, and individual storms manifest. For this reason, this study will look to corroborate previously established relationships from studies that use previous
reanalyses datasets {cite}`trenberth_storm_1991` {cite}`lorenz_eddyzonal_2001` {cite}`eichler_comparison_2013` {cite}`trenberth_progress_1998` {cite}`sinclair_objective_1994`, and to glean new insights. This will be achieved by using time series of standard indices of the four outlined phenomena, details of which can be found in the methodology.

Significant uncertainties around projected storm track behaviour are associated with behaviour of SAM and ENSO in particular. SAM appears as a modal phenomenon with two phases, positive and negative, which result in changes in average pressures over the Antarctic region and midlatitudes. The meridional temperature gradient is intimately connected to pressure gradient through thermodynamic laws, therefore pressure changes observed with SAM affect storm track position and storm frequency and intensity, as a stronger pressure gradient will cause greater instabilities and equatorward migration of the storm track. The recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole – the primary driver of the SAM positive trend – whose future is dependent on the concentration of atmospheric CFCs, introduces another uncertainty in projected storm track behaviour, whilst continuing greenhouse gas emissions are expected to push the positive trend (Thompson et al. 2011).

ENSO is an interannual cycle that directly affect the shape and position of the storm track via its teleconnections. Sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) are a major driver in the formation and propagation of storms {cite}`hoskins_new_2005`. SSTAs arising during warm El Nino events cause strong convection in the tropics, creating the necessary conditions for propagation of Rossby wave trains from the sub-tropics. These wave trains move poleward, and are the major source of observed teleconnection patterns such as the Pacific South American (PSA), a large-scale wave pattern particularly apparent during austral winter. The storm track in turn amplifies and even controls the propagation of wave trains, creating a positive feedback loop {cite}`trenberth_progress_1998`. The mechanism for this is described in greater detail in _find citation_ and Goyal et al. 2021 {cite}`goyal_zonal_2021`.

_Do I need this, with it not being model-based? :_ Although the IPCC AR6 finds no significant trends in ENSO from the instrumental period, Ying et al. 2022 identified consensus between models of future higher ENSO-related SSTs and precipitation – exaggerated signals compared to mean annual global equivalents (Ying et al. 2022). This suggests ENSO amplitude will increase with rising temperatures, more intensely affecting the storm track.

ZW3 has also recently been linked to Rossby wave trains caused by tropical convection events {cite}`goyal_zonal_2021`. ZW3 is a quasi-stationary wave that plays a pivotal role in poleward heat and momentum transport, especially in winter. Rossby wave trains are deflected equatorward by wave guides in the high latitudes and eventually decay in the tropics – this creates a ZW3-like
signal, a wave with three highs and lows around 55°S. ZW3 centres of high and low pressure interact with storms and can exacerbate extreme weather events. Changes to SH circulation that generate tropical convection events such as ENSO are expected to affect ZW3, as well as warming SSTs, which will weaken teleconnections through increased tropospheric static stability, weakening vertical motions and convective circulation. As westerlies strengthen with warming temperatures, stationary wave theory suggests that the wavenumber – inversely proportional to zonal mean flow – generated by tropical convection events will decrease.
Shifting storm tracks and changes in characteristics of storm systems have significant implications for New Zealand, as it lies on or near the storm track. 

This research project will document storm track characteristics with the latest ERA5 reanalysis dataset, and identify teleconnections or interactions between the storm track, SAM, ENSO, IOD and ZW3. Inspection of patterns using time series of 500hPa geopotential height variance field and standard indices corresponding to each phenomenon will form a key part in this analysis.

The storm track position is also strongly influenced by the seasonal cycle and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), _find citation_ and this study hopes to document whether ENSO and ZW3 also have an effect.

Lorenz and Hartmann 2002 {cite}`lorenz_eddyzonal_2001` make a clear link between how baroclinic storms affect the mean westerly flow through the SAM. We hope here to make similar progress but for ZW3 and ENSO. The link between low-frequency variation, or how ZW3 and ENSO affect the mean geopotential height, and the high-frequency variance is not clear. This study hopes to shed some light on the direct consequences of phenomenal events.

The seasonal and annual relationship between two fields -- mean height and short-timescale variance -- was investigated, with the variance field considered to be the analogue of storm activity.

# Methodology

We use observational data acquired from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ (ECMWF) Reanalysis, 5th generation (ERA5) {cite}`hersbach_era5_2018`, 1979-2021. The ERA5 reanalysis uses historical observations combined with modelling and data assimilation techniques to provide global data. We use 500hPa geopotential height field gridded at 1°latitude/longitude resolution -- which adequately resolves synoptic-scale extratropical storms (~1000km across) -- 500hPa is commonly used as "the level of minimum convergence", meaning the physics is simpler and more linear. The seasonal cycle was removed from the data by subtracting the smoothed long-term daily mean. Two statistical fields were selected to investigate the effect of storm activity on the general circulation: mean height field anomalies characterise the general circulation pattern; variance over a high-frequency timescale was calculated to identify the short-term effect of passing storm centres. To isolate variance due to storm activity, a 2--8-day bandpass filter was applied to daily data as per Trenberth 1991 -- the filter 'turns-off' all variance signals outside that frequency range. This frequency band is on the order of the lifetime of an individual storm, and still retains maximal variance. To ease the computational load, the monthly average of the filtered variance anomalies and mean height anomalies were considered.

We examine the relationship between the two fields by using Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) to identify the prominent modes of variation. This was done for the full monthly time series as well as for data grouped seasonally, the same procedure was applied to daily data to capture finer temporal variability. North's et al. Rule of Thumb {cite}`north_sampling_1982` was used to quantitatively identify non-degenerate MCA modes. For the monthly series, only the first two modes of the full time series were unique according to the North et al. criterion, and seasonally only austral summer possessed any non-degenerate modes -- again the first two. However, the proceeding modes were ostensibly ZW3 patterns of various phases so were considered briefly, but should be treated with caution. This was another reason for repeating the MCA on the daily time series, since the error in the covariance estimation is inversely proportional to the degrees of freedom, i.e., the sample size. To find values for variance over a daily timestep, a rolling window function was applied. Two windows were tested, 7- and 15-days, with the aim of selecting the smallest window length whilst minimising noise. It was found that the 15-day window leading modes explained more variance and the patterns were more consistent, therefore a 15-day window was chosen. Only the leading five modes were inspected, despite more higher order modes being non-degenerate, however the amount of variance explained was less than 5% after these first five modes. 

Monthly time series for standard indices quantifying the aforementioned atmospheric phenomena were collected to investigate their relationship with storm activity. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was used to quantify ENSO, with data collected from NOAA. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was conducted on the mean height field anomalies and the normalised first principal component was used to define SAM. Zonal Wave 3 is particuarly mobile, meaning any index looking to capture it must consider the phase. For this reason the index formulated in Goyal et al, 2022 {cite}`goyal_new_2022` was chosen, with data retrieved from the author. This index defines a ZW3 magnitude and phase from the first and second principal components of 500hPa meridional wind field anomalies, the details of which can be found in the original paper. The ZW3-magnitude time series was split into phase bins. Initially, 30 degree intervals were used, however this severely limited the sample size, particularly for seasonally grouped data. Therefore, 60 degree bins were chosen instead, increasing the average sample size to 20 -- any time series with less than 10 data were ignored. Correlation and covariance between time series for indices and mean height & variance anomalies were calculated at each grid point to establish whether any relationship existed. For ZW3, these were calculated for each phase bin by taking data with corresponding time stamps between the field and ZW3-magnitude when in some phase. 

Correlations operate under the assumption of some linear relationship, so provides only a limited analysis -- any non-linear relationship will be lost. The ZW3 index possesses a gamma distribution, such that before any linear statistics would require a sample distribution transformation into a standard Gaussian. However, the SOI also possesses a positive skew, with significant outliers that also limit the application of Gaussian statistics. For these reasons, the Spearman rank correlation method was used, since it is non-parametric, so makes no assumptions of a linear relationship nor about the distribution of a sample. It is also robust to outliers skewing the result. The significance of any relationship was determined using the method outlined in Wilks {cite}`wilks_stippling_2016`; controlling the False Discovery Rate. $\alpha_{FDR}$ was chosen as $0.1$, as per Wilks' recommendation. The same analysis was repeated on data grouped by season, in order to identify the existence of seasonal cycles. Analysis with the unprocessed time series is hereafter referred to as the full time series, and data grouped by season referred to as seasonal data.

In support of this analysis, composites of the mean height & short-scale variance fields during extreme events of each phenomena, i.e., when the index was most positive or negative, were created. The ninety-fifth- and fifth-percentiles for each index were composited, with a minimum of five data (some percentiles were different, given a sample size smaller than 100 -- quantiles are indicated in each figure), hereafter referred to as upper and lower qunatiles. For ENSO, positive index indicates a La Nina event (upper quantile), whilst a negative index indicates El Nino (lower quantile). For the SAM, a positive index indicates SAM in its positive mode, and vice versa. For ZW3 however, the index magnitude is always positive, hence lowest indices are when ZW3 is at its weakest. These composites were created anyway, as they help to identify what the effects of a strong ZW3 are.

## Maximum Covariance Analysis

- Results & Discussion

Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) was performed on the variance and mean height fields for both monthly and daily data, to identify the main modes of variability between the two fields. Daily variance was unavailable so it was calculated using a rolling window on 12-hourly data.

### MCA with Monthly Data

8% of variance in MCA explained by ZW3, in agreement with Goyal et al. 2021 {cite}`goyal_zonal_2021`??

### MCA with Daily Data

#### Zero-Lag

Of the two windows tested, 7- and 15-days, it was found that the 15-day window leading modes explained more variance -- _why_? -- and the patterns were more consistent -- _again, why_? -- in the full time series and across seasons. Only the leading five modes were inspected, despite more higher order modes being non-degenerate, however the amount of variance explained was less than 5% after these first five modes. Inspecting modes higher than the leading three is ill-advised as the higher modes tend to be either have no physical basis or a combination of variance from different mechanisms. This is what is seen here, with the higher order modes explaining very little variance and possessing unusual patterns that aren't clearly associated with known phenomena or previous results, _(are there any previous results that support these findings?)_. 

A textbook SAM patttern is the leading mode for the full time series and each season, explaining between 6.8-9.8% of variance. This is well-known to be the leading mode of variability across the SH so is to be expected, and supports the idea of SAM as a controlling influence of feedback between mean height field and variance field. 

The second mode is less consistent, but resembles an ENSO-like pattern across all figures. Key features such as the large band across the subtropical Pacific and oppositely signed-region over the Amundsen Sea are not consistently identified in the second mode, and have differing geometry and locations to the picture seen in composite and covariance figures. The typical ENSO pattern, assumed to be the same as that seen in figure (_get figure number_), is identified in higher order modes in a few datasets, e.g. the fourth mode in JJA and fourth mode in the full time series. It is likely that the typical features expected from an ENSO signal are distributed across several modes, given the close connection with SAM. However, the composite maps, discussed in detail below, suggest the manifestation of ENSO is season-dependent, and a typical ENSO pattern is only seen in spring. There are features in other seasonal composite figures that appear to correspond with features seen in higher order modes. _Correlate SOI with other modes._ To investigate what modes are linked with ENSO, correlations were calculated between the second principal component (PC2) and the SOI. Correlations are fairly low in all time series except for SON, when ENSO records its strongest events. PC2 in spring has a very similar pattern to the extreme events for the same season (see composite figure), which agrees with the higher correlations, but other seasons have quite different patterns, with features resembling some of the higher order MCA modes. There are different types of ENSO events that occur, so this may indicate that some event-types, e.g. central Pacific El Ninos, are more common in some seasosn more than others, _(however, ENSO events have typical timescales longer than a single season, so this may not make sense)_.

__Correlate other PCs with SOI__

#### Lagged Data

A 5- and 10-day lag was added to the variance field to investigate whether short-timescale variance response to mean height field anomalies is simultaneous or delayed, in a similar fashion, though limited in scale, to the analysis performed by Lorenz and Hartmann 2001 {cite}`lorenz_eddyzonal_2001`. It was found, in the analysis with the full time series, applying a lag generally decreases the explained variance in higher order modes, but increases the amount explained for the leading two modes. Another common feature, with few exceptions, is 10-day lag explaining more variance than 5-day lag for the leading two modes. As a rule, autumn explains lower variance than any other season by a couple of percentage points. Correlations between mean height and variance PCs are of roughly the same magnitude for leading two modes, but are lower for higher order modes, in opposition to the trend found in explained variance. _Why would this be?_

There is a similar pattern in seasonal data for the modes, though the difference in explained variance is likely insignificant. Generally, greater lag has lower correlations between the two PCs, though the 5-day lag doesn't appear to be significantly different from the zero-lag for the leading PC. The second PC, which generally has higher correlations between variance and mean height PCs than the leading PC, has considerable differences between lagged analyses in all seasons except SON, which is consistently high.

_To establish which mode is most closely associated with ENSO, the time series of PCs 2-5 were correlated with the SOI._ Generally, correlations steadily decrease between PC2 and SOI with increased lag in all seasons except JJA, which is highly correlated with zero-lag, a magnitude of 0.41, but has minimal correlation with 5- and 10-day lagged analyses, ~0.05. 

### Presence of ZW3 Signal in Leading Modes

Aside from the leading modes, ZW3-like signals are very common in the higher order modes from the monthly data MCA. However, no ZW3 pattern emerges in any of the leading five modes from MCA with daily data. There are higher order modes in the daily data analysis, not directly associated with ENSO, with zonal wave signals; ZW4 and ZW5 signals appear, as well as atmospheric wave trains in the subtropics. This could be an artifact of the rolling window averaging, or it could speak to something about ZW3 timescales.

### SAM

Covariances between mean height anomalies and the SAM index show a textbook SAM pattern. The picture is highly symmetrical: a large central region of positive anomalies surrounded by an annulus centred at approximately 50S with three negative maxima, centred over the eastern Indian Ocean, the western Atlantic over South America, and western Pacific, southeast of New Zealand. There is also diminished covariance in the negative ring around the central Pacific, and another lesser region found south of Australia. This picture is largely in agreement with previous literature, _find citations, I think Hoskins and Hodges proposes a reason for these highs and lows_., with the three maxima explained by ... according to ... (Hoskins anf Hodges??), and is a pattern that is repeated in seasonal data to varying degrees. There is a positive skew in the correlations, with maximum positive values reaching 0.8, whilst the negative extreme is 0.5, another pattern that is repeated across seasons, _why is there a positive skew, is this backed up by other literature?_. -- _Might have to change these numbers to covariance values if we go ahead with covariance figures._ High correlations between the SAM index and mean height field are to be expected since the SAM index was defined as the leading principal component of the mean height field.

All seasons possess the annulus with three maxima, though some are more broken/sparse than others. Austral summer is the most symmetrical, _backed up by literature?_, with a near perfect ring around 60S, well-defined meridionally. In austral winter, the positive ring is broken up into the three prominent maxima, with a small deviation equatorward, which are broader than the tightly defined maxima in summer. Maximum correlation (_covariance_) values are stronger than in summer. This is likely because the wintertime sees the westerly flow move poleward, which also occurs during positive SAM. Due to the definition of the SAM index, and likely some remnant of the seasonal cycle remains in the data despite deseasonalisation, this means the pressure field in winter is more closely correlated with the first principal component. The transition seasons, spring and autumn, share a mix of the characteristics of summer and winter. 

In all seasons, as well as the full time series, there is a protruding region over the central Pacific above the same location as the Amundsen sea low, _purely coincidence, or is there a reason for this?_. This is visible in all seasons, but undergoes a seasonal cycle in which it is most clear during autumn and winter, where the ring is broken by this intruding region, and most diminished in summer. A seemingly consistent change occurs between seasons -- the zonal shifting westwards of the three positive maxima as the seasons progress.

_Check your understanding: a higher thermal gradient, e.g. in winter, means that the westerly flow is stronger. Does this mean that the faster flow will lose its meridional component faster or slower? i.e. is the polar jet further equatorward or poleward?_


Another textbook SAM pattern is seen in the short-timescale variance field, with alternating negative and positive annuli emanating from Antarctica. Positive correlations are centred over the pole, although relatively weak. A ring of negative correlations is found around 60S – over the zero line in the mean height field – with three highs centred over the same longitudes, though displaced poleward, as the highs for mean height anomalies: in the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans. The negative correlation indicates that the storm track is more active in these regions during a SAM positive phase, and less active in the negative regions, in good agreement with literature, _find citations_. A further band of positive correlations are located equatorward, though much more broken. Absolute correlation values are lower however, than for the mean height field; positive and negatives reaching an extreme value of around 0.3 and -0.4 respectively, expressing the same skew as in the mean height, although oppositely signed. The lower covariance values are expected once more since the SAM index is defined by the mean height field, and there are other strong influences on the variance field, _what are they?_.

Seasonally, the negative covariance ring is consistent, centred over 60S, but becomes more broken during winter and particularly autumn. The weakened SAM signal across the lower latitudes in autumn and winter may be an indicator of the splitting jet stream, and the presence of a sub-tropical jet, such that the storm incidence is more distributed meridionally, _(probably nonsense...)_. Generally, the outer region of negative storminess (at lower latitudes) is less distinct and more diffuse than the inner ring throughout the seasons. In all seasons, there is weak covariance over the Pacific Ocean, co-located with the anomalous protrusion observed in the mean height field, whereas there is consistent positive covariance over the Indian ocean. This could be a result of the greater temperature gradient seen over the Indian ocean due to the distribution of Antarctic land mass.

It's interesting that summer has the clearest pattern of covariance, whereas winter, the period when the meridional temperature gradient is steepest and the polar jet is strongest, is much less distinctive. Lower correlation and broken rings.

### SOI

Mean height anomalies show a strong band of positive covariance over the Pacific Ocean from north-east of New Zealand, around 30S, to southern South America, around 40S. This indicates average height of the 500hPa geopotential field is greater than average during cold La Nina events, and lower than average during warm El Nino events. The strongest correlation occurs in the western Pacific with a value of just less than 0.6, where the effects of ENSO are felt most keenly. The covariance values are smaller than that seen in SAM, as expected again due to SAM's index definition. Aside from the band across the Pacific, there are a further two very weak local maxima around 40S, one centred over the mid-Atlantic, another over the mid-Indian ocean. 
The existence of these other alternating maxima and minima is suggestive of a ZW3 pattern, but are not deemed significant according to FDR. There is also a strong minimum south of this narrow band above the Amundsen Sea low, with a correlation of -0.35, a feature commonly associated with ENSO events, see (_find citations_).

The strong positive covariance band across the Pacific is identified consistently across all seasons, but extends into a ring around the pole during austral spring and summer. In summer, there is the most SAM-like signal present: negative correlation over Antarctica, and almost a whole ring of positive covariance encircles the pole. However, this ring is more equatorward, and less symmetrical. The strongest maximum is over the western Pacific at 30S-40S unlike SAM, which is indicative of the height field's localised response to ENSO. Also important to note is that only local maxima are significant, not the entire ring as with SAM. The region of negative covariance located above the Amundsen Sea low is another consistent feature across the seasons, _is this because ENSO events always cause this?_ Winter and spring exhibit a particularly apparent ZW3-like pattern, _why might this be?_. The strongest covariance between the SOI and mean height field occurs in springtime at around 0.75, _change values for covariance_, simultaneously with the strongest presentation of ENSO events, _find citations_.

In the short-timescale variance field, a band across the Pacific Ocean, similar to that observed in the mean height anomalies field, is seen although here it is further poleward, with one tail ending over the southern South American peninsula, the other tail stretches to around 60S, south of New Zealand. As with SAM, the maximum covariance is lower in the variance field, reaching a maximum value of 0.3 _(replace value)_. A significant negative region is found directly north of the western end of the positive region, though it is much less extensive. _No region that is connected to the Amundsen Sea low... why not?_

There are fewer obvious trends between seasons compared to SAM, however the positive band across the Pacific is present in all seasons (although varying longitudes) and aligns well with the maximum gradient in the mean height field, as would be expected. This is again indicative of the localised response to ENSO, and little more can be said of the teleconnections during any season other than summer. In the summer months, there is another SAM-like signal, though less distinct. Of note is the strong positive region in the Pacific, wrapping around and poleward from South America to south of New Zealand, and two positive maxima west of the Antarctic peninsula and off the coast of the Amery ice shelf, which together constitute an almost complete ring. Applying the FDR method suggests there are no significant regions, but this does agree with the accepted notion that the response to ENSO is at its most SAM-like during summer, _find citations_. The only season that possesses significant regions in the variance field is spring, likely due to the strong covariances found during this month as a result of ENSO's strongest events occurring in spring, _find citations_.

### ZW3

Covariance with mean height field anomalies across all phase bins possesses a ZW3-like signal, with the expected three highs (positive covariance) and lows (negative covariance), and each subsequent phase bin is zonally displaced in accordance with the shifting ZW3-phase. These highs and lows are consistently characterised as significant by the FDR method, however highs or lows in some phase bins are missing, either weakly covarying or missing entirely. This is likely because ZW3 is generated in the subtropics near anomalous tropical convection events, which create the ideal conditions for Rossby wave trains {cite}`goyal_zonal_2021`. As the Rossby wave trains propagate, energy and momentum dissipate, hence amplitude shrinks, leaving less of a impact on longitudes far from the place of origin.

In the seasonal figures, the ZW3 signal is consistently observed across all phase bins and seasons. However, during summer there is a much less distinct pattern in each phase than can be seen in other seasons. One reason for this could be the weaker westerly flow in summer. However, ZW3 is associated with anomalous convection events, particularly in the western Pacific warm pool and during El Nino events, the strength of which are heightened in summer, suggesting ZW3 should be stronger in summer. (_What is the effect of La Nina events on convection in the tropics? - could this contradict the above?_) Another reason for the lack of a ZW3 coherent pattern could be the small sample size, meaning outliers have a great impact that obscures the pattern. This could also be true of the other seasons, where the occasional phase bin also presents a less distinctive pattern. 

It must be noted that very few significant regions in the seasonal data exist in either field. However, the same ZW3 signal is observed for most phase bins in most seasons in the mean height field, hence the lack of significant results is likely due to the small sample size alone and can still be interpreted with caution. {cite}`goyal_new_2022` finds ZW3-like EOFs explain a greater amount of variance in the meridional wind anomalies field, therefore there is a greater likelihood of finding significant results using this field in place of the geopotential height. It can be expected significance would be found with a greater sample size; Goyal et al. also uses the past 1200 years from the CESM model in their analysis, greatly improving the robustness of their results. However, it does increase reliance on model output. The current analysis works with limited data points, 60 degree bins as opposed to the 20 degree bins used in Goyal et al., _What impact does this have on our analysis?_ This approach could be applied to the current analysis to improve likelihood of finding significant regions and result robustness.

There are no obvious patterns or trends in the variance field covariance maps; many figures can be construed as noise, with no apparent coherent regions that align with any feature in the mean height field covariance maps. There are some phase bins figures, generated using the full time series, that have a vague ZW3 signal -- negative covariance well-aligned with positive covariance in the mean height field -- however they are few and no significance could be established. Similarly, no significant regions were found for seasonal data, which, given the difficulty in identifying any physically meaningful response that explains observed covariance patterns, could well be a realistic result, despite the relatively strong relationship found.

One reason why there might be little coherent pattern is that the mobility of ZW3 means that the physical response is smeared over when undergoing the statistical analysis applied. Relatively transient signals will be lost due to the mean over  a monthly interval being considered. There are regions of strong correlation, yet very small, which may be because they are consistently present over the whole phase bin, whereas the surrounding regions inconsistent and are smeared over by statistical methods.

### Southern Annular Mode

Upper and lower quantiles of the full time series indicate the response of the mean height field to SAM modes is quite linear. The main difference between the two is the sizeable maximum in western Atlantic, off the South American coast; much more prominent in the upper quantile. This is reflected in the variance field upper composite, where there is significant storminess in the same region, whereas there is a much smaller variance anomaly in the lower composite, _why might this be? Any literature to corroborate this?_. Both mean height and variance fields have significant maxima in the Indian Ocean, in agreement with previous observations. Notably there is a skew in extreme variance values, the maximum over the Indian Ocean is the strongest anomaly, however it is much greater in the lower composite than the upper composite, an absolute difference of $5000m^2/s^2$.

Non-linearities in the mean height field response to SAM become apparent in the seasonal data. Upper and lower quantile composites take on different characteristics, with unique signatures. In summer, positive SAM has a highly symmetrical textbook pattern. However, negative SAM is relatively asymmetrical, with the Pacific quadrant missing the negative anomalous section of the ring, and the positive anomalies emanating from the pole do not reach as far north.

The largest anomalies occur in winter, as expected, and present asymmetrical patterns in both positive and negative modes, as is typical of wintertime SAM, _see corr/cov maps and literature_. However, there is a unique feature in the autumn negative SAM; a highly positive anomalous region located over the Amundsen Sea -- the strongest anomalies in any season -- as though the central region over the pole has been shifted towards the Pacific. It should be noted that the response of the mean height field is not isolated to responses to SAM, but the effects of other phenomena can leak into the picture. Given that the composites are an average picture of, in this case, the top 25 months, the effect should be minimal. However, Campitelli et al. 2022 {cite}`campitelli_assessment_2022` find that the asymmetrical component of SAM (A-SAM) can be isolated and is ZW3-like in nature. They also find that the connection between SAM and ENSO is entirely explained by A-SAM. This is a persistent phenomenom that could very well intrude on the composites, hence the strong asymmetry in this composite could be a result of a persistent simulataneously strong ZW3, _(a bit wishy-washy, not sure on this)_. Spring presents another notable picture; the negative SAM is textbook, but a strongly negative region intrudes over the Pacific into much lower latitudes. _What does any of this mean??_

The relationship between the mean height field and variance field is by no means clear either, with varied patterns of anomalies arising. Summer is a textbook SAM picture, and is linear in its response for positive and negative SAM. One noteworthy feature however, is the extensive and deep region of negative variance anomalies in the Pacific quadrant, colocated with the unusually stable mean height field (lack of anomalies). This translates well, since a more stable mean height field in the Pacific would lead to fewer storms.

Winter once more possesses particularly strong variance anomalies, in line with the response of the mean height field. As usual, nicely aligned with the regions of steepest gradient (over the zero-anomaly line). It could be argued that the extent of anomalies shifts from the western to eastern hemisphere between positive and negative modes. Positive SAM also has very little negative anomalies, whereas negative SAM has very strong positive anomalies at lower latitudes in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.

Spring is very unusual, completely different to the expected SAM signal. In the positive mode, an extensive band over 60S stretches from the mid-Pacific to South Africa, before switching to a strong negative region that continues across the Indian Ocean. Negative SAM seemingly has no pattern at all, with localised regions of strong anomalies and little overall structure. Autumn has very strong anomalies that obscure some of the structure, but there remains a clear SAM signal for both positive and negative modes.

The splitting of the jet stream is apparent in autumn and winter; increased storminess in the lower latitudes can be seen in negative SAM (lower composite) and the meridional distribution of variance is more extensive in positive SAM, i.e., there is increased storminess in observed in lower latitudes regardless of SAM state. However, there is not the expected effect in the Pacific, where the sub-tropical jet stream is most prominent. 

### El Nino-Southern Oscillation

The full time series presents a picture for the mean height field similar to that seen in the correlation and covariance maps, with a strong response over the Pacific, particularly in the subtropics and over the Amundsen Sea. During La Nina events, a deep positive band of anomalies stretches across the subtropical Pacific and a further two positive regions are present over the Atlantic and Indian oceans. The Amundsen Sea low is also very prominent, presenting a somewhat ZW3-like signal, lending itself to the hypothesis presented in Goyal at al. 2021 {cite}`goyal_zonal_2021` -- ENSO-associated convection events drive ZW3. The pattern is quite SAM-like, a feature that has been previously documented, _find citations_. A similar mirror image is found for El Nino events, though with a couple of features that indicate non-linearities. The deep band of anomalies across the Pacific and over the Amundsen Sea are again present, but oppositely signed. There is also a poleward local negative minimum in the Pacific, adjacent to the Amundsen Sea. The two maxima over the Indian and Atlantic oceans are weaker, and another positive maximum is found off the south coast of Australia.

Variance anomalies are well-aligned with the steepest gradient in the mean height field in both La Nina and El Nino events, as per always. There is SAM-like signal, with a ring of positive storminess wrapped around the pole, centred over 50S. These are much stronger over the Pacific, a stronger localised response, however the effect does clearly extend across to the western hemisphere. However, this band could also be a product of SAM, as the two phenomena are strongly interlinked. The generally weaker magnitude of mean height anomalies translates across to the variance field, with generally weaker anomalies in El Nino events. _Check the sign of these, because technically El Nino is stronger._

The response in the La Nina events is inconsistent across seasons, with the usually ever-present band across the subtropical Pacific missing in some seasons, as well as the anomalous region over the Amundsen Sea. There are strong positive anomalies over the pole in spring, and strong negative regions over the pole in winter, however there is a distinct lack in the full time series, which could be a result of averaging the seasonal cycle. 

Summer La Nina events see a diminished localised response in the Pacific ring, but stronger teleconnective maxima in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. There is the usual deep region over the Amundsen Sea however. The Amundsen Sea anomalous region is shifted westward in El Nino events, _which is a feature also found MCA on daily data..._ The wintertime El Nino composite presents a more familiar ENSO response, superposed with a band of positive anomlies over the Indian Ocean and south of Australia. 

In autumn El Ninos, there is a deep negative region much further west of the Amundsen Sea, _which seems like it could be another feature of MCA on daily data..._ Autumn La Ninas has a more ENSO-like pattern, but with a strong negative band poleward of the typical position, centred on 50S. There is also a series of lows and highs around 50S but with a frequency higher than a typical ZW3. Spring time sees an El Nino picture almost identical to the full time series. Given that this is the time of year when El Nino is at its strongest, this is likely because spring is overrepresented in the full time series composite. Spring La Ninas have the expected subtropical positive band, but also has the aforementioned positive anomalies over the pole.

Variance anomalies generally align well with regions of steepest gradient in the mean height field. The variance field is most SAM-like during summer, with an almost whole ring of heightened storminess over 60S in La Nina events, and a negative semi-ring over 45S, both interupted over the Pacific. El Nino events see a similar structure, except the negative band over 45S is over the Pacific and extends more meridionally. Winter has a less coherent structure; El Nino events have a blue band of negative anomalies aligned with the steep gradient in the mean height field -- across the Pacific between the subtropics and Amundsen Sea. _(Would you always expect to see higher storminess in the regions with steepest gradient? If so, this doesn't make much sense.)_ There are a few other maxima that align with the mean height field, but don't speak to a bigger picture. 

Autumn also has little structure, at least few clear teleconnections. The usual localised response is present in the Pacific, with negative and positive anomalies aligning with the mean height field in both El Nino and La Nina events. Both La Nina and El Nino seem to elicit the same response, albeit to varying degrees in slightly different locations, but the general structure is the same -- lower variance/storminess over 60S and greater storminess over 45S. Spring returns to a SAM signal, particularly in La Nina events. A heightened storminess is present over most of the Pacific, but there is a partial ring of lower storminess is between South America and Australia, via the South Africa. El Nino almost mirrors the La Nina composite, with a negative band across the Pacific and positive in the opposite hemisphere. There is also a region of much greater storminess between Tasmania and Antarctica, that aligns with the trough between the strong positive and negative regions in the mean height field mentioned above. _Why is there so much variation in ENSO's response over the seasons? This is something that can be linked to the Daily MCA also, as many of the features seen seem to be present as MCA modes._

# Discussion

- Goyal finds strong seasonal cycle in phase and amplitude when using meridional winds with the seasonal cycle retained. 
    - 20-40 degrees between winter and other seasons and magnitude shift of 0.6-0.8, peaking in winter.
- Goyal uses CESM2 model of last 1200 years when considering the impact of ZW3 phase to make results more robust, this is the difficulty we have with only 20 data points for 60 degree bins. He also uses 20 degree bins. What impact does this have on our analysis?
- What impact does the linkage between meridional heat transport and ZW3 have on storm tracks?
- Goyal finds clear link between ZW3 phase and sea ice extent, which is also connected to the storm track, because a reduction in sea ice will reduce the meridional temperature gradient, reducing the speed of the polar jet and baroclinic instability, the potential energy store of storm tracks. This is a lagged relationship, as sea-ice extent does not respond immediately, meaning that some of the influence of ZW3 is missed in a simultaneous analysis.
