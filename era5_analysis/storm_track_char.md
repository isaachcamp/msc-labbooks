# Storm Track Characteristics

## Observations, Simulations, and Dynamics of Jet Stream Variability and Annular Modes, Kidston et al. 2010 {cite}`kidston_observations_2010`

The authors suggest the annular mode is baroclinic in nature, i.e., the meridional wandering of the jet stream is due to baroclinic processes, which cause a persistence in meridional location and lengthening of e-folding time (a proxy for decorrelation time, _I think_). This is a result of the strength of "thermally indirect circulation" which influences the baroclinic feedback.

For the following is formulating from a Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework:

In a quasi steady state, the total zonal force (per unit mass) exerted on the mean flow is $\del . F$ is inversely equal to the product of meridional velocity and the coriolis parameter. This has a local maximum at the core of the jet, requiring there be a minimum in the meridional velocity at the poleward flank of the jet, creating a meridional gradient, hence a circulatory motion. The authors suggests, since momentum flux dissipation near the surface -- the main sink of eddy flux momentum according to the authors, though this is left uncited -- there is a net rising and adiabatic cooling on the poleward flank, and sinking and warming on the equatorward flank. This reinforces a meridional temperature gradient at the jet core, hence reinforcing baroclinic instability. This positive feedback reduces meridional wandering, and prolongs any stochastic displacements away from the mean position.

They also suggest that the subsequent enhanced meridional temerature gradient leads to a sharper, more meridionally defined storm track.
